i3bmfmc,2022-04-03 23:33:33,GoldenValleyGoats,tvuq79,I would like to start selling coffee but I need some info,My advice is only grind what you can move in a week as ground coffee quickly loses its aroma and flavor compared to fresh.

i3bsaut,2022-04-04 00:52:47,JFA00,tvtifq,New Coffee Roasting Hobbyist,Im not familiar with the user interface of the Gene but I do know that stalling a roast (and letting the beans drop in temperature during your roast) is not beneficial to the coffee.   My advice would be to aim for a continously rising temperature and finishing a roast in about ten minutes (depending on the machine and the batch size). The longer you roast the more flavor compounds will evaporate/change.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvtifq/new_coffee_roasting_hobbyist/i3bsaut/'

i3cehlb,2022-04-04 05:26:58,BhodiSatoshi,tvtifq,New Coffee Roasting Hobbyist,I hate to be that guy but roasting on a Gene or similar machines just doesn’t give you enough control or roast feedback.  It sounds like you’re baking your beans. Baking provides the same visual results as roasting but lacks all the flavour.   I would try a smaller batch size and seeing if you can get FC in or around 8:30-10 minutes. And don’t stall your roasts.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvtifq/new_coffee_roasting_hobbyist/i3cehlb/'

i3e0z9b,2022-04-04 12:10:24,Kit_Khat,tvtifq,New Coffee Roasting Hobbyist,No I understand completely what you mean - and went into the purchase understanding it wasnt a complete roaster. With that being said Ive heard a lot of folks talk about roasting good coffee on a Gene Cafe and believe with enough practice I could potentially get close.   Considering your advice would you have a profile that would work well with a washed Ethiopian on another roaster? I plan on trying my hand with that this afternoon and could tweak it accordingly.,i3cehlb,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvtifq/new_coffee_roasting_hobbyist/i3e0z9b/'

i3f2ivn,2022-04-04 16:12:39,Fireworks1,tvuq79,I would like to start selling coffee but I need some info,I would highly advise against this. Not only is it dubious but you would also be undercutting (presumably) the roaster involved. Coffee isn’t like other food products where you can buy something somewhere (avocados for example) and turn it into a new product (guac) and sell it. Coffee is coffee. Moreover most roasters have grinders and will grind for customers already using a better grinder than you probably own. I would maybe start trying to roast get ahold of that then reassess. Good luck!,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvuq79/i_would_like_to_start_selling_coffee_but_i_need/i3f2ivn/'

i3fc49o,2022-04-04 17:16:07,trewert_77,tvvdeo,Pulled shortly after second Crack and let sit a few days what do you think?,Ok you probably would be disappointed with this batch then. If it shows oils right out of the roaster it’s really overdone. Oily beans tend to go rancid fast. Cup this next day and try it with your favorite brew method after 2 days. If you find it too roasty/dark. I suggest trying to brew with lower temperatures. This is the way I salvage my overdone roasts. Cold brew also works decently well with dark roasts.  if you want to retain the original flavor notes try to drop just after first crack ends.   For improving your roasts you can consider tracking: temperature during roast and the rate of rise (ROR). You can research roast curves and artisan software if you can add temperature probes to your roaster.  You can predict your 1st crack timing once you’ve gained enough experience and artisan does a decent job at predicting too.   Measure the density of your beans at least once at your first roast for your new batch of beans. Density affects how much heat your beans can take and how fast it may develop. If you have a very low density bean like a monsoon Malabar it can burn very quickly if you apply too much heat.   This is a deep rabbit hole my friend have fun.,i3f8uz6,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvvdeo/pulled_shortly_after_second_crack_and_let_sit_a/i3fc49o/'

i3fhogz,2022-04-04 17:55:34,CoriNixore,tvvdeo,Pulled shortly after second Crack and let sit a few days what do you think?,I think the biggest tip I can give you is to just point you towards some really great bits of info on the topic:  Some videos on the subject: [Spromethius](https://youtu.be/5Dib_af3_lQ)  [Rob Pirie](https://youtu.be/zH00wZW0Ess)  [Mill City Roasters](https://youtube.com/c/MillCityRoastersMN)  The good books: [Modulating the Flavor Profile of Coffee](https://www.amazon.com/Modulating-Flavor-Profile-Coffee-Hoos/dp/0692417702)  [The Coffee Roasters Companion](https://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Roasters-Companion-Scott-2014-05-04/dp/B01FGOH0AW/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?adgrpid=64556347828&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4P_p7tn79gIVshXUAR3omALYEAAYASAAEgJtGvD_BwE&hvadid=274721889731&hvdev=m&hvlocphy=9017357&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=1693771880973183310&hvtargid=kwd-568758058312&hydadcr=15147_10362772&keywords=coffee+roaster%27s+companion&qid=1649119769&sr=8-1)  And since I’ve seen you mention you’ve got more of a taste for darker roasts but you want to engage with some of the lighter roasted coffees that highlight the origin I’d really encourage you to buy a couple different coffees from different specialty Roasters and do some cuppings. I really encourage comparative tasting as it gives the coffees context when they’re next to each other. Do some blind next to a dark roast and you might be surprised what you end up enjoying the most! Hope that helps,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvvdeo/pulled_shortly_after_second_crack_and_let_sit_a/i3fhogz/'
i3fs5kx,2022-04-04 19:12:14,coffeebloke,tvvdeo,Pulled shortly after second Crack and let sit a few days what do you think?,The darker the roast the less caffeine you also roast any sweetness out of the coffee and shorten shelf life. No more than three minutes into first crack is my mantra. With that said coffee is like wine it’s deliciousness sits in the palate of the consumer…if others enjoy it you’ve done great! 😁  Quick addition sight smell sound…you’ll smell the caramelisation you’ll see the color change and you’ll hear the drum become quieter as the beans loose moisture…the goal for me is keeping the oils inside the bean oily beans will allow oxygen flavour deprivation to occur far more easily. Don’t feel you need to wait for first crack to end sample and smell look and hear. Always perfecting!!,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvvdeo/pulled_shortly_after_second_crack_and_let_sit_a/i3fs5kx/'

i3gfru6,2022-04-04 22:42:37,JFA00,tvtifq,New Coffee Roasting Hobbyist,Sure. Im using a DIY fluid bed roaster controlled using Artisan so temperatures may differ. Your best bet is to watch (dry end: the beans have all turned yellow and all green colours have disappeared) and listen (first crack).  Preheat: 200 degrees Celsius  Dry End (no greens left all yellow): 04:00 170 degrees Celsius   First Crack start: 8:00 220 degrees Celsius  Drop: Somewhere between 9:00 and 10:00 and 230-235 degrees Celsius depending on the desired roast level,i3e165r,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvtifq/new_coffee_roasting_hobbyist/i3gfru6/'

I’m wondering how do we slow down a roast without sacrificing the profile?,Id suggest posting your roast strategy.. Charge temp batch size heat settings air settings etc. Roast curve would be helpful. No one will be able to offer much for your specific roast without any of the specifics.  Sounds like you charged super hot and then kept gas too high for too long. 5ish minutes in you should be around 300°F. Around 6 you should be around.. 320° Id say if around that point your ROR is in.. low 20s?

I’m wondering how do we slow down a roast without sacrificing the profile?,I roast on one of those. It sounds like your P level is too high for the batch size.  I find the mid range from say P5-P7 is good for 400-500g batch sizes P8 for the 750g range and P9 for full batches.  If your drum speed is cranked on smaller batch sizes you’re going to get a lot more convection as well which could be speeding things up too much.  I’d do a test with 450g with a 275 pre heat temp and a P6 D7 F3 or 4 just to diagnose the issue further. If you get a fast roast with those settings then it’s likely a problem with the Bullet.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tystnv/hey_im_roasting_on_the_bullet_aillo_v2_and_my/i3uk4bn/'

I’m wondering how do we slow down a roast without sacrificing the profile?,HEY! Fellow Bullet user here.    Just a few things-  I am a long term Huky user and new Bullet user.  The Bullet measures and reports temps differently than typical/traditional drum roasters so there isnt tons over overlap.    Ive also found the Bullet doesnt do (or I dont do) turning point the same as with the Huky or other traditional drum roasters.   That said youre the first person Ive heard of using such a high charge temp.  If youre not getting scorching good for you- I might try it.  Im preheating much lower and unable to get the high initial ROR Im used to.    Whether lengthening the roast or not makes it better will be determined by further testing.    On the Huky to extend the roast to a drop time from 8-10 minuites my 30-40 ROR peak occurs somewhere around 2 minutes with yellow marked at 4:30.  I start cutting heat in 15% increments starting from 135C to 150C depending on bean.  Subsequent cuts are in 15% or 30% increments depending on how much energy I want to carry through 1C.   I roast light and typically dont want more than about a 6C change from 1Cs to 1Cend/drop over 1:15 to 1:45 (15% RDT to 18% RDT).    Do you ever post on the roastworld system?

I’ve had success with just 230C on 600-700g batches in 60-65F ambient.   Peak at 20C ROR and keep the P 9-7 until first crack while using higher fan speeds F3-5 to draw air through and out.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tystnv/hey_im_roasting_on_the_bullet_aillo_v2_and_my/i3zfkwj/'

I adjust the drum back up to 9 right before first crack.  I try to get about 8-9 minutes minimum on the roast even when its a lighter charge like this and can only do it if I bring down the preheat temp to 260c or even lower with soft beans.,i3zfkwj,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tystnv/hey_im_roasting_on_the_bullet_aillo_v2_and_my/i3zkx1k/'

The ROR is basically first derivative and we need the trend of the second derivative (trend of the ROROR) to describe the different accelerations of roasting.

You parenthetical comment (the one that tasted roasty due to fast roast time) is of particular note:  ALL OF MY ROASTS TASTE ROASTY.    Ive charged low 220C middle 240C now 260C  Ive done the change one thing at a time thing to try to isolate the culprit but unsuccessful to date.     Particular things about the Bullet.    I always have yellow a lot earlier in the Bullet than Huky and cant really get the Malliard phase where I tend to like it.   Max ROR is always lower in the Bullet than Huky.    The chaff starts separating from the bean pre yellow and stays around the beans the entire roast.  I rarely ever have chaff pre yellow in the Huky trier and never have that much in the cooling tray either as with the Bullet.

i4ppph0,2022-04-14 08:50:45,Formal_Bar_8406,u3jd6m,Hiring someone for a roasting role,Roastmaster Green Coffee Buyer Coffee Quality Assurance or Production Manager roles are oftentimes common job progressions for a roaster. In small to medium coffee roasting companies I often see a hybrid role where the green buyer is also a QA sometimes the head roaster is all (3) (woe to them. That is a meaty workload).  The QA and Production Manager are perhaps the two roles that don’t require as much specialized training because sensorial evaluation (QA) is a skill that she may already practice during production cuppings. As for the production manager if she has excellent time management organization inventory management familiar with commodity logistics and communication skills then she would likely succeed in that role (ignoring other obstacles). And by the way I’m not under appreciating production managers as getting coffee out the door is just as important as the roaster’s job.   The green coffee buyer role needs a few more things above a firm understanding of sensory evaluations with respect to the SCA cupping format and scoring. What you may ask? Green coffee grading skills (not just reading a book and taking a CQI class but serious field processing experience or something adjacent like an origin quality lab). She should also have some grasp of demand planning and forecasting. Familiarity with  contracts is a plus. She needs to understand most importantly the way in which these coffees are being translated to the roaster and to the customer. That said she either works within or establishes core attributes for the blends or SO. I forgot to mention sample roasting.  A head-roaster like the green coffee buyer has a wide tool kit and deep experience is necessary. The headroaster is responsible for hiring training and maintaining the roasting team (and the equipment the roasting team uses: SO IMPORTANT). She establishes internal consistency goals for production roasts and operator protocols for receiving/loading/roasting. Additionally she balances the production needs across the week by redistributing roast workloads to those days where labor and material are available. She is also responsible for blend design and blend consistency as new coffee lots are rotated in. The QA overlaps with this.  So I know this is a lot to digest. If you take away anything then let this anecdote be it: as a former roaster for a small regional roaster once my roast shift concluded I hoped back on to the production floor to bag fold and fulfill orders. Sometimes I delivered coffee to the retail locations. Sometimes I installed/fixed equipment. The roastery had high turnover and so what was supposedly a temporary scenario became part of the DNA of the organization. There was always burn out at the roastery but there were also baristas who were eager to learn to roast in spite of the big pay cut (no tips).   It wasn’t a great long term situation for me  in terms of work life balance. Nor was it for others who wore multiple hats.   When I look at job postings in the specialty coffee world and see that phrase “multiple hats” or the job description during the interview violently veers from what was initially written you better believe that’s a red flag to me and a hard pass.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/u3jd6m/hiring_someone_for_a_roasting_role/i4ppph0/'

But if you’re only looking for someone to do the roasting and maintenance of the roaster then I’m failing to see how that’s a full time job. Are you wanting the role to be full time to attract better candidates?   If so what happens once they’ve been trained up and they realize it’s not full time work that their days are being filled with a bunch of filler tasks not related to roasting?   Where I differ from the other responder is that in a small operation it’s common for one person to wear multiple hats. Your operation simply isn’t big enough for full time department heads.

But if you’re only looking for someone to do the roasting and maintenance of the roaster then I’m failing to see how that’s a full time job. Are you wanting the role to be full time to attract better candidates?   If so what happens once they’ve been trained up and they realize it’s not full time work that their days are being filled with a bunch of filler tasks not related to roasting?   Where I differ from the other responder is that in a small operation it’s common for one person to wear multiple hats. Your operation simply isn’t big enough for full time department heads.

i4ppph0,2022-04-14 08:50:45,Formal_Bar_8406,u3jd6m,Hiring someone for a roasting role,Roastmaster Green Coffee Buyer Coffee Quality Assurance or Production Manager roles are oftentimes common job progressions for a roaster. In small to medium coffee roasting companies I often see a hybrid role where the green buyer is also a QA sometimes the head roaster is all (3) (woe to them. That is a meaty workload).  The QA and Production Manager are perhaps the two roles that don’t require as much specialized training because sensorial evaluation (QA) is a skill that she may already practice during production cuppings. As for the production manager if she has excellent time management organization inventory management familiar with commodity logistics and communication skills then she would likely succeed in that role (ignoring other obstacles). And by the way I’m not under appreciating production managers as getting coffee out the door is just as important as the roaster’s job.   The green coffee buyer role needs a few more things above a firm understanding of sensory evaluations with respect to the SCA cupping format and scoring. What you may ask? Green coffee grading skills (not just reading a book and taking a CQI class but serious field processing experience or something adjacent like an origin quality lab). She should also have some grasp of demand planning and forecasting. Familiarity with  contracts is a plus. She needs to understand most importantly the way in which these coffees are being translated to the roaster and to the customer. That said she either works within or establishes core attributes for the blends or SO. I forgot to mention sample roasting.  A head-roaster like the green coffee buyer has a wide tool kit and deep experience is necessary. The headroaster is responsible for hiring training and maintaining the roasting team (and the equipment the roasting team uses: SO IMPORTANT). She establishes internal consistency goals for production roasts and operator protocols for receiving/loading/roasting. Additionally she balances the production needs across the week by redistributing roast workloads to those days where labor and material are available. She is also responsible for blend design and blend consistency as new coffee lots are rotated in. The QA overlaps with this.  So I know this is a lot to digest. If you take away anything then let this anecdote be it: as a former roaster for a small regional roaster once my roast shift concluded I hoped back on to the production floor to bag fold and fulfill orders. Sometimes I delivered coffee to the retail locations. Sometimes I installed/fixed equipment. The roastery had high turnover and so what was supposedly a temporary scenario became part of the DNA of the organization. There was always burn out at the roastery but there were also baristas who were eager to learn to roast in spite of the big pay cut (no tips).   It wasn’t a great long term situation for me  in terms of work life balance. Nor was it for others who wore multiple hats.   When I look at job postings in the specialty coffee world and see that phrase “multiple hats” or the job description during the interview violently veers from what was initially written you better believe that’s a red flag to me and a hard pass.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/u3jd6m/hiring_someone_for_a_roasting_role/i4ppph0/'

I’m wondering how do we slow down a roast without sacrificing the profile?,I roast on one of those. It sounds like your P level is too high for the batch size.  I find the mid range from say P5-P7 is good for 400-500g batch sizes P8 for the 750g range and P9 for full batches.  If your drum speed is cranked on smaller batch sizes you’re going to get a lot more convection as well which could be speeding things up too much.  I’d do a test with 450g with a 275 pre heat temp and a P6 D7 F3 or 4 just to diagnose the issue further. If you get a fast roast with those settings then it’s likely a problem with the Bullet.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tystnv/hey_im_roasting_on_the_bullet_aillo_v2_and_my/i3uk4bn/'

I’m wondering how do we slow down a roast without sacrificing the profile?,HEY! Fellow Bullet user here.    Just a few things-  I am a long term Huky user and new Bullet user.  The Bullet measures and reports temps differently than typical/traditional drum roasters so there isnt tons over overlap.    Ive also found the Bullet doesnt do (or I dont do) turning point the same as with the Huky or other traditional drum roasters.   That said youre the first person Ive heard of using such a high charge temp.  If youre not getting scorching good for you- I might try it.  Im preheating much lower and unable to get the high initial ROR Im used to.    Whether lengthening the roast or not makes it better will be determined by further testing.    On the Huky to extend the roast to a drop time from 8-10 minuites my 30-40 ROR peak occurs somewhere around 2 minutes with yellow marked at 4:30.  I start cutting heat in 15% increments starting from 135C to 150C depending on bean.  Subsequent cuts are in 15% or 30% increments depending on how much energy I want to carry through 1C.   I roast light and typically dont want more than about a 6C change from 1Cs to 1Cend/drop over 1:15 to 1:45 (15% RDT to 18% RDT).    Do you ever post on the roastworld system?

I roast on a Huky so the max capacity is lower than the bullet. My batch sizes are around 350g and charge temp between 350°F and 380°F. 520 is super high.,i3ukgzj,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tystnv/hey_im_roasting_on_the_bullet_aillo_v2_and_my/i3vrgbs/'

I’m wondering how do we slow down a roast without sacrificing the profile?,Thanks for the link.    You parenthetical comment (the one that tasted roasty due to fast roast time) is of particular note:  ALL OF MY ROASTS TASTE ROASTY.    Ive charged low 220C middle 240C now 260C  Ive done the change one thing at a time thing to try to isolate the culprit but unsuccessful to date.     Particular things about the Bullet.    I always have yellow a lot earlier in the Bullet than Huky and cant really get the Malliard phase where I tend to like it.   Max ROR is always lower in the Bullet than Huky.    The chaff starts separating from the bean pre yellow and stays around the beans the entire roast.  I rarely ever have chaff pre yellow in the Huky trier and never have that much in the cooling tray either as with the Bullet.    Im beginning to wonder if that burnt chaff is the issue.,i3ya5vw,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tystnv/hey_im_roasting_on_the_bullet_aillo_v2_and_my/i4aermh/'

I’m wondering how do we slow down a roast without sacrificing the profile?,Wow this looks like your ROR is in a steady crash/free fall!  Come more this to a recent roast of mine with a much more subtle and steady declining ROR.   https://roast.world/@ryweller@gmail.com/roasts/GyFzv3-4n53L8U3rC5mt_  I’m certain that we lack the tools in roast time to call out the difference.  The ROR is basically first derivative and we need the trend of the second derivative (trend of the ROROR) to describe the different accelerations of roasting. It would be notable by section (yellowing acceleration vs browning acceleration rate).,i3zfcka,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tystnv/hey_im_roasting_on_the_bullet_aillo_v2_and_my/i418esj/'

I really encourage comparative tasting as it gives the coffees context when they’re next to each other. Do some blind next to a dark roast and you might be surprised what you end up enjoying the most!

No more than three minutes into first crack is my mantra. With that said coffee is like wine it’s deliciousness sits in the palate of the consumer…if others enjoy it you’ve done great! 😁  Quick addition sight smell sound…you’ll smell the caramelisation you’ll see the color change and you’ll hear the drum become quieter as the beans loose moisture…the goal for me is keeping the oils inside the bean oily beans will allow oxygen flavour deprivation to occur far more easily.

If you find it too roasty/dark. I suggest trying to brew with lower temperatures. This is the way I salvage my overdone roasts. Cold brew also works decently well with dark roasts.  if you want to retain the original flavor notes try to drop just after first crack ends.   For improving your roasts you can consider tracking: temperature during roast and the rate of rise (ROR). You can research roast curves and artisan software if you can add temperature probes to your roaster.  You can predict your 1st crack timing once you’ve gained enough experience and artisan does a decent job at predicting too.   Measure the density of your beans at least once at your first roast for your new batch of beans. Density affects how much heat your beans can take and how fast it may develop. If you have a very low density bean like a monsoon Malabar it can burn very quickly if you apply too much heat.   This is a deep rabbit hole my friend have fun.,i3f8uz6,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvvdeo/pulled_shortly_after_second_crack_and_let_sit_a/i3fc49o/'

i3f2ivn,2022-04-04 16:12:39,Fireworks1,tvuq79,I would like to start selling coffee but I need some info,I would highly advise against this. Not only is it dubious but you would also be undercutting (presumably) the roaster involved. Coffee isn’t like other food products where you can buy something somewhere (avocados for example) and turn it into a new product (guac) and sell it. Coffee is coffee. Moreover most roasters have grinders and will grind for customers already using a better grinder than you probably own. I would maybe start trying to roast get ahold of that then reassess. Good luck!,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvuq79/i_would_like_to_start_selling_coffee_but_i_need/i3f2ivn/'

i3cehlb,2022-04-04 05:26:58,BhodiSatoshi,tvtifq,New Coffee Roasting Hobbyist,I hate to be that guy but roasting on a Gene or similar machines just doesn’t give you enough control or roast feedback.  It sounds like you’re baking your beans. Baking provides the same visual results as roasting but lacks all the flavour.   I would try a smaller batch size and seeing if you can get FC in or around 8:30-10 minutes. And don’t stall your roasts.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvtifq/new_coffee_roasting_hobbyist/i3cehlb/'

i3bsaut,2022-04-04 00:52:47,JFA00,tvtifq,New Coffee Roasting Hobbyist,Im not familiar with the user interface of the Gene but I do know that stalling a roast (and letting the beans drop in temperature during your roast) is not beneficial to the coffee.   My advice would be to aim for a continously rising temperature and finishing a roast in about ten minutes (depending on the machine and the batch size). The longer you roast the more flavor compounds will evaporate/change.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvtifq/new_coffee_roasting_hobbyist/i3bsaut/'

With that being said Ive heard a lot of folks talk about roasting good coffee on a Gene Cafe and believe with enough practice I could potentially get close.   Considering your advice would you have a profile that would work well with a washed Ethiopian on another roaster? I plan on trying my hand with that this afternoon and could tweak it accordingly.,i3cehlb,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvtifq/new_coffee_roasting_hobbyist/i3e0z9b/'

i3gfru6,2022-04-04 22:42:37,JFA00,tvtifq,New Coffee Roasting Hobbyist,Sure. Im using a DIY fluid bed roaster controlled using Artisan so temperatures may differ. Your best bet is to watch (dry end: the beans have all turned yellow and all green colours have disappeared) and listen (first crack).  Preheat: 200 degrees Celsius  Dry End (no greens left all yellow): 04:00 170 degrees Celsius   First Crack start: 8:00 220 degrees Celsius  Drop: Somewhere between 9:00 and 10:00 and 230-235 degrees Celsius depending on the desired roast level,i3e165r,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tvtifq/new_coffee_roasting_hobbyist/i3gfru6/'

i2fmezy,2022-03-28 06:13:08,Specific-Plantain-42,tq24jf,Something about brewing your own Roast,Congrats on roasting your own coffee!  Dont mind the negative comments on here...  The main thing is that you are enjoying the process and the coffee.   If you want some tips to improve the brew here you go.  - pour starting from the center working your way out to fully saturate the grounds.  Try to stop before water starts dripping through although a little is fine.  Let the coffee bloom for about 30-60 seconds.  This helps to achieve more even extraction.  - after the bloom pour slowly in a circular pattern working from center out then back in.  Dont let the water height rise too much.  You dont want to just fill the filter up.  - try to avoid pouring down the side of the filter paper.  Leave some grounds between your water stream and the edge so that water doesnt bypass the grounds.  - on rinsing the filter. You can take or leave this one.  Sometimes I do sometimes I dont.  Some coffees and filters it makes more of a difference on then others.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tq24jf/something_about_brewing_your_own_roast/i2fmezy/'

No matter how bad I screw up my brew my home roasted coffee is a thousand times better than a meticulously brewed cup of stale Folgers from the supermarket aisle.   As a fun experiment I brewed several different methods (French press pour over flair espresso AeroPress metal and paper filter) and my family sampled the cups. While none were bad the clear winner was the AeroPress using a paper filter.    At the end of the day if you enjoy your coffee then that is all that matters.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tq24jf/something_about_brewing_your_own_roast/i2isrwa/'

You’ll notice the biggest improvement in your cups by grinding a little bit finer and if you plan on starting a roasting company definitely invest in a good burr grinder!

i1mnuds,2022-03-21 22:46:33,oldxscars,tjvsp7,What Grinder Do You Use?,What proportion of your retail sales are currently pre-ground vs. whole beans?  New Zealand based roaster we currently do about 170k lbs. We generally use a Mahlkoenig VTA 6S for a dual purpose: our pre-ground Decaf to wholesale customers and pre-ground coffee for retail customers. Its high volume fast and can do our full range from 250g retail to 3kg wholesale but I find the grind setting less precise than I want.  Depending on the ratio of pre-ground to whole bean you might be totally fine with a Mahlkoenig EK43 - if Im grinding coffee for a friend or family I grind mine on the EK as I like the control of the settings but its definitely faster on the VTA. Theyre everywhere reliable easy to service burrs are easy to find and they have a more nuanced grind setting. I guess since youre outsourcing this another good question to ask would be - who is going to service this grinder? If youre doing commercial volumes youre likely to go through burrs quicker than a domestic setting and so perhaps a trusted local third-party technician might have a preference on a brand or model they carry parts for in case of a breakdown or a lead on a distributor who can offer a good price.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tjvsp7/what_grinder_do_you_use/i1mnuds/'
i1nauh1,2022-03-22 04:07:38,thatjacob,tjvsp7,What Grinder Do You Use?,Does the roaster youre working with have a destoner? If not just go with two large Bunn grinders to start and do burr modifications if youre not happy with the grind quality.

i09ioyt,2022-03-11 10:28:32,jonhasglasses,tbuwyi,Using NFTs with coffee supply chains,Very interesting idea! You are taking on the fair trade and equal exchange systems by doing this which is not necessarily a bad thing just something to be aware of. As a coffee drinker I care more about it tastes like than where my beans come from as the inequality between the farmers and consumers is great no matter how many stickers are on the bag and that inequality is pretty ubiquitous even in the most wholesome  sourcing of green coffee. As a professional having a more transparent system for bean sourcing would be excellent ethical reasons aside I think it would make working directly with Farms an easier task if a system like this was widely adopted. That being said the current system is mostly functional so what’s the value proposition you are actually bringing to the table is what I’d focus on if I were you.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tbuwyi/using_nfts_with_coffee_supply_chains/i09ioyt/'
i0a1xqq,2022-03-11 12:32:28,jonhasglasses,tbuwyi,Using NFTs with coffee supply chains,At its most simple NFTs are a decentralized certificate of authenticity. The issue with fair trade and equal exchange is they both brought transparency to the market but it’s not complete because those entities are the ones that issue the certificate of authenticity and that creates a conflict of interest. If widely adopted any decentralized system of tracking the commodity of green beans would be a benefit to most people in the market. Would it be much better than what we have now? Maybe.

With decentralization we lose any oversight at all and are told an impossible promise of authenticity when its all thrown out the window as soon as the coffee leaves the producers farm to get processed and start the many change of hands.

i11woci,2022-03-17 11:44:22,YellowRoosterHome,tbq06m,Cup of Excellence,Check out Bourbon Sidra and Inmaculada Geisha from [Yellow Rooster Home](http://www.yellowroosterhome.com)  they/we are a green specialty coffee importer that sells to home roasters micro-roasters and competitive baristas.   A little about Sidra and Inmaculada. So Sidra is an exotic variety and this one in particular is 120 hour anaerobic fermentation. I am a Q Grader and this cup easily scores between 89 and 90 points. The producer is Edwin Norena who is a Q Grader university-trained agronomist and COE Judge in Quindio Colombia! Next Inmaculadas coffees are really renowned. Inmaculada Coffee Farms are the producers that provided the winning coffees for the World Barista Champs in Milan last year. 1st 2nd and 3rd place winners all competed (and won) with coffee from these incredible producers. Their geisha this season is also an anaerobic natural fermentation cupping at 89.75 points. Really beautiful deep round sweet and complex.   Talking about these coffees is literally what i do and I love it. So please feel free to talk to me about any of it! DMs always open <3,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/tbq06m/cup_of_excellence/i11woci/'
i08r8k8,2022-03-11 07:23:52,ryanrocs,tbq06m,Cup of Excellence,Thanks for that I’ve seen Crown Jewels they lack grades but probably give enough info for people that are very knowledgeable about coffee to make an informed low-risk decision. I don’t know how shade vs non shade amount of rain and wind ultimately affect flavor yet. I might be that knowledgeable in a year or two. If I could order a sample that would be nice but i don’t think you can on those.

hzsunzo,2022-03-07 21:53:15,DirtyD1701,t987xa,Newbie question,I roast 1 lb batches in a large sauce pan.  Afterwards I pour the roasted beans into a large flexible colander and agitate them for 3 or 4 minutes with a motion kind of like youre flipping something in a frying pan but using shorter movements.  It helps them cool and it sifts out virtually all the chaf.

hzuidkf,2022-03-08 08:33:09,TopherRoaster,t8olfs,Any recommendations for an all electric 2-5kg roaster?,I started roasting in 94 on a small ir7 Dirdrich. I have used so many machines ranging from probat to Ambex as well as a Royal from 1896.  Let me rephrase my original quote. I prefer gas over electric. Reaction time with temperature is quicker on gas. Also if you start to learn on an electric machine and outgrow it in a month.. you wont have a learning curve when you upgrade to a larger gas machine. If you never out grow a 2 or 3 kilo you dont have a business you have an expensive hobby.  The people at coffeetec have loads of used equipment. https://coffeetec.com/   Lastly I would hire a consultant to help you learn to roast.  Good luck!

Honestly I’d do one like 2min past first crack just to taste it.   And if you don’t have an espresso recipe for brewing it’s really hard to diagnose if the problem is the roast or the extraction.

hz2nand,2022-03-02 10:28:58,daustin777,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,Ive dont understand peoples desire for flavored coffee beans. If you like the flavor of honey you probably then have some honey in your kitchen. Why not put some honey in your cup of brewed coffee.   I did a web search and some roasters are offering this. Im with you in thinking you cant just tumble some real honey with the roasted beans. I could be wrong but I think flavoring is done with flavor-infused oils.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz2nand/'
hz2lvg7,2022-03-02 10:20:02,skeenek,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,I dont think its possible.

hz3e41x,2022-03-02 13:19:46,Confucius_Clam,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,Nice collaboration idea if you get the partnership to work.    What if you used a co2 decaffeinating  (super critical or sub critical co2 process) on the honey then  medium roast coffee then let the oils on the beans take the powdered honey then bag?  The question would remain how long is the bag good for before spoiling due to the extra sugar present.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz3e41x/'
hz4ca1j,2022-03-02 17:25:47,FCoffeeTest,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,I would absolutely not like this product as I imagine it would come out but I do like the creativity.  Ive roasted coffees that had distinct honey flavors and since we only roast south/central American coffees it must have been Costa Rica or Guatamela and I would guess Guatemala because we go for candy-like flavors. You have to hit just the right roast level (mediumish) in our case. That might be too subtle for these folks but a light-medium roasted floral coffee could do it. A Guatemala Geisha might do it but $$$.  IMHO honey flavor on its own is actually kind of weird. The sweetness makes it pleasing and again IMHO. Like if you had a mead was that over fermented (I think that is what happened) and all the sugar is converted it kind of tastes like toothpaste.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz4ca1j/'

hz2ojnx,2022-03-02 10:36:57,lostcoffeecup,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,I prefer just a straight cup of coffee however this costumer wants to promote their honey business with their own line of honey coffee.

hz2n1ar,2022-03-02 10:27:20,lostcoffeecup,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,They are wanting a honey flavored coffee. I do my flavoring after the beans have cooled and let dry for at least 48 hours before grinding.  But like I said I usually use a concentrated flavor or something like a port wine that will soak into the bean.  I just think the honey will become just become a sticky mess and gunk up the grinders.,hz2lvg7,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz2n1ar/'

hz4b5fd,2022-03-02 17:16:33,BhodiSatoshi,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,Eh….. I’d casually remind them that the best way to promote their honey business isn’t through releasing a line of honey infused coffee but through talking about their bees and their flowers.  But if you do decide to do it I’d look into dehydrating the honey grinding it then mixing with ground coffee. And not putting your branding anywhere near it and have them sign a non-disclosure.   Another route could be honey infused cold brew.,hz2ojnx,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz4b5fd/'
hz408hl,2022-03-02 15:51:54,wtf_are_crepes,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,Maybe put a special label on it or look for notes that would be perfect with honey and get them to advertise it as a great natural alternative to sugar packets or artificial sweeteners.   Combining these for promotion is like a paint company combining all their paint colors. Like yea it’s possible but why? You just get a weird product that maybe some people will buy because it’s cool/trendy when you could just have a display with locally roasted coffee and local honey to put into it with a display sign talking about how your two companies worked together to come up a coffee perfect for her honey. Same goal is achieved.   Just seems like extra headache for something that can be achieved with less steps less potential waste and would probably appeal to more people. Honey in tea too can be promoted on the same display.   I personally wouldn’t mix honey into my roasted beans. If it jams up someone’s equipment it’s on you and not the honey people. If they’re demanding stuff they don’t know about that’s ridiculous. I don’t ask our honey people to make rose honey no matter how good it sounds because I understand that’s not how it works.,hz2ojnx,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz408hl/'

hz2qug5,2022-03-02 10:51:31,thatjacob,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,It absolutely would ruin the grinders. Your only option is to flavor post grind which comes with its own issues. Even then clumping would be a huge issue and theres no benefit to doing that vs just squirting some honey in a drip brew filter before brewing a pot.  Id just direct them to going with a custom roast/blend that is made to be paired specifically with their honeys flavor profile. I wouldnt get their honey anywhere near your roaster or grinder. Not just for mechanical reasons but also cross contamination with your other roasts which could be an issue for some allergens/vegans,hz2n1ar,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz2qug5/'
hz2qv9l,2022-03-02 10:51:39,skeenek,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,Yeah understood and agreed. Just saying that I don’t think you’re going to be able to do it without contributing something weird to a honey processing method maybe. There’s no way real honey is going into a roaster or tumbler in my opinion much less a grinder.  Maybe the solution is to gauge their interest in making an oil or flavor out of their specific honey.,hz2n1ar,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz2qv9l/'
hz770si,2022-03-03 09:28:50,FCoffeeTest,t54uyx,Honey Flavored Coffee,A more ordinary Guatemala might be good enough and reasonable price depending on what they need. Maybe obvious but youd have to do a fair amount of sampling to hit the mark.  I guess the other way to approach it is a coffee that is complemented by adding honey rather than a coffee that tastes like honey on its own. I would think that has to be a low-acidity but still light/medium roasted coffee which not everyone will accept. Kind of fun to think about best of luck.,hz7191h,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t54uyx/honey_flavored_coffee/hz770si/'

What particular markets do you have in mind - is it your regional budget chain smaller one store grocery or are you looking at Whole Foods?  I wouldnt count on grocery to be the jump that makes running a coffee roaster enough to live on generally it has a lot of great advantages (consumer exposure ability to reach economy of scale for custom retail packaging & green buying diversification of business channels) but its some of the lowest margin volume you can do & requires a lot of extra investment especially in the first couple years to make it successful.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t2zwit/looking_for_advicetips_on_how_to_sell_my_coffee/hypvn5c/'

hysmzkf,2022-02-28 09:37:16,poopwasfood,t2zwit,Looking for advice/tips on how to sell my coffee to local supermarkets in bulk,Hello op I am in a similar situation and I have spoken to many coffee professionals and the consensus is just want another commenter said. Basically grocery stores are not money makers they have the slightest profit margin imaginable require the most effort packaging specific labeling requirements upc/sku registration insurance process foods registration and a brutal ordering amount and buy back inventory reality.  The pluses are that you get great exposure to customers and the potential to sell to them. I was given the advice to wait until it really makes sense to go into grocery stores.   I hope this is not a discouraging thing to hear but it is what I have heard from a few sources.  I would love to check out your company if you would be willing. You can message me if you like I probably have more cool info to share. Good luck and great job so far.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t2zwit/looking_for_advicetips_on_how_to_sell_my_coffee/hysmzkf/'

hyzhvt0,2022-03-01 17:41:32,sprodown,t2zwit,Looking for advice/tips on how to sell my coffee to local supermarkets in bulk,Combining this with feedback to comments from below:  - Before considering grocery you need to have or be willing to invest in a weigh-fill nitrogen flushing sealers adequate bag/label supplies (whatever your vendor lead time and usage is then add a 50% buffer -- even more recently since everyones bags come from China).   - On the roasting capacity end this is a rule Im entirely BSing but you want 2-3KG of roaster capacity for each individual grocery store youre supplying assuming youre roasting 4-5 days per week -- so a 12KG roaster might work for a really small six-location local grocer but if you want to get into your regional Whole Foods with four or five dozen stores you better have a full-bag roaster.  - Make your SKUs generic -- Guatemala Medium Roast not this-specific-farm-coffee. You need to have flexibility year to year to find the right coffee value (price + quality) to fit your brand expectations and your margins.  - Understand the relationship between your price to the grocer & your shelf price and work backwards from there. Owning a price point is a huge part of success!  - Use appropriate case quantities and minimum orders. Grocery wont deal with shipping charges from a vendor so figure the case minimum to make the math work you might do cases of 6 bags and minimum 4 cases per order for instance.  - Dont rely on self delivering to make the math work assume you will be paying UPS/Fedex Ground. Grocery receiving hours usually start pre-dawn and end mid-afternoon so they conflict with roastery working hours.  - Get familiar with GS1 & IX-ONE.  - Work out a promo agreement and get into a schedule. Example agreement might be that you do a two week sale every quarter where you charge $1 less and the store takes $1 off so its $2 off on the shelf. There are lots of consumers who will only try your brand when they see it on sale and some of them will stick around!  - Design your ecommerce to supplement grocery customers and provide some avenue to get the same price point they do in the store with free shipping.  - Demo in stores! Do it yourself dont outsource it its a huge pain its incredibly expensive but do it for the first couple years. It pays dividends both in bringing in new customers and getting you face time with buyers and staff. You might need to hire someone full time who does this for at least half their hours if youre in a good selection (two dozen+) stores.  - Conversely generic advertising (Find us in X store!) is a loser. Dont worry about it -- use it passively as a tack-on to other advertising but its not going to move the needle.  - Always be ready to say yes. Want to do another promo? Sure! Holiday Blend? Well do it! Expanding to new stores or other volume bump? Were ready (even if youre not and make sure you live up to it - just be ready to both drop the cash right away to get the equipment to do it or labor).  - Delivery speed is the name of the game. They want their orders in seven days from purchase order you should have them there within three days. Be the best coffee vendor they have.,hypy2j5,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t2zwit/looking_for_advicetips_on_how_to_sell_my_coffee/hyzhvt0/'

hyzj2rb,2022-03-01 17:50:22,sprodown,t2zwit,Looking for advice/tips on how to sell my coffee to local supermarkets in bulk,Assuming youre talking about the first point -- Ill give the caveat that doing all that isnt applicable if youre doing a single small specialty grocer but on the other hand of that you might only be doing 12 bags a week so its not a huge dollar mover either way. Doesnt mean its not worthwhile to do - but for $ significant grocery I do think you need to be ready to finance some equipment.

hymgydv,2022-02-27 01:48:20,TigersRreal,t2ilny,Interested in the field,Sick! I’m excited that you’re excited! I would suggest getting a job at a coffee shop that uses a specialty coffee roaster. It’s a good sign of they sell bags of coffee bonus pints if it’s local. Become a barista and learn everything you can.  Remember it’s not always what you know- it’s who you know. Ask questions find out who the roaster is. Chat up the coffee delivery person- chances are they do more than deliver.  As a barista you’ll be exposed to the back end of coffee and you’ll learn a lot about what differentiates roasts.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t2ilny/interested_in_the_field/hymgydv/'

Did that a few years then moved to a city with a large specialty coffee presence. Got a job at very large specialty roaster as a barista. Did that for 2 years took a job in production did that for 7 months got a job as a green coffee handler did that for a month then a roasting apprenticeship opened up and I got it. Apprenticed for a year and now am a production roaster. I do have to say it does not pay well. I hardly have time to cup coffees or even talk to our QA team.

Any help is appreciated!,Ok so I recently took over the roasting duties of a small company after a year and a half of roasting elsewhere. While I am an experienced roaster my previous employers did not give me maintenance work and had all repairs cleaning and maintenance performed by mechanics. So far one of my biggest issues is with this cooling tray. As you can see the lip of the dumping end is supposed to be screwed in. However the screws have been gone for some time and on one side it’s held in place with some kind of adhesive. The other side has nothing of the sort and beans are getting stuck and wedging themselves in which is a constant headache for me. Does anyone know what sort of adhesive is on the other side? Is it food safe and if so where can i get some more? this isn’t a permanent solution but if it’s doable it will have to work for now.

Clean the area it’s supposed to seat flush in and figure out why it doesn’t. Get the proper screws to hold the discharge gate down or retap so they do. As long as your cooling tray isn’t warped it should be pretty easy depending on the quality of the original piece. Having an air hose would help to clear the tray but if properly put together it shouldn’t be needed. Good luck!  Edit: as the owner (your boss owns the roaster outright I imagine) you as a representative should be able to contact their customer support and ask questions on specs etc. Plus learning the machine you’re roasting on is one of the perks of being a roaster learn as much as you can your value as an employee will increase.,hyaz1vm,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/t0nhay/anyone_able_to_help_with_a_cooling_tray_issue/hyb1uny/'

hxwt7wn,2022-02-21 18:56:22,jeremyroastscoffee,sxzd6m,Why not sell green beans?,the margins are not attractive when you consider that your whole business model as a roaster relies upon the disparity between green prices at bulk and what the market will bare to pay for roasted coffee by the lb/12 oz bag. I’ve worked for importers that sold green locally but only really made a profit by selling gear and running home roasting courses. you’re basically asking a roaster to eat their labor and forfeit potential profit in exchange for razor thin margins unless they mark up the cost of green so substantially it’s not attractive to home roasters,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sxzd6m/why_not_sell_green_beans/hxwt7wn/'
hxv4c6t,2022-02-21 11:49:37,uuutangnamegenerator,sxzd6m,Why not sell green beans?,Because its additional work. Lets say he makes 7$ selling you green beans he paid 7$ for at 14$/lb. Lets say it takes him ten minutes to get a bag weigh package and then sell you the greens. Thats a ten minute disruption to workflow of the normal roasting process now his bag of greens has a non-standard quantity of beans in it and hes had to stop roasting to make this individual request.       Yes the margin may be higher but the volume is too low. Also if his roasting nets 60$/hr of profit even at lower margins because of scale 7$/ 10 minutes means hes losing money compared to just doing what hes geared up to do.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sxzd6m/why_not_sell_green_beans/hxv4c6t/'
hxxpzo0,2022-02-21 23:49:11,TheTapeDeck,sxzd6m,Why not sell green beans?,I sell green for $0.50 per ounce to local roasters. Just enough to be a little more than it’s worth IMO. Not enough to hurt and not enough to drive people away. I do this because I don’t really want to sell green coffee but because I don’t want to turn someone away if they’re interested. This is more than the green is worth but if I were a retailer is less than the necessary markup to justify the product. I wouldn’t buy a product for $4.50 and sell it for $8. Our wholesale customers want to make 2x what they pay when they sell.   You can get coffee cheaper from a lot of places. You generally can’t get what I have on offer. And I routinely recommend Sweet Maria’s and Burmans as a cheaper alternative. Still some locals want the same thing were roasting for benchmarking reasons.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sxzd6m/why_not_sell_green_beans/hxxpzo0/'
hxvpb63,2022-02-21 14:09:59,TigersRreal,sxzd6m,Why not sell green beans?,Eh you’re missing out on true opportunity cost tho. Or is it worth it to you to gain loyalty from these customers? One could argue you’re training them in a behavior that does not benefit you if taken to the extreme- or if just a few more customers start purchasing your beans.,hxveryx,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sxzd6m/why_not_sell_green_beans/hxvpb63/'

hxvgz6g,2022-02-21 13:14:16,opalsilk,sxzd6m,Why not sell green beans?,OP could make arrangements with the roaster ahead of time so it’s not as much of a hassle as you’ve described. Say OP tells him how much he wants so next time the Roaster orders beans he can just add that to the total weight.

hxxaenq,2022-02-21 21:13:53,TigersRreal,sxzd6m,Why not sell green beans?,Yeah I hear ya. It’s an interesting line- the difference between doing something kind for customers or being taken advantage of. I feel like I toe that line all the time and it’s very obvious when something is fair or not. People would understand if you said ‘look I can sell em to you for $5/lb but when I roast them these same beans go for $18/lb.’ All in all I personally think it’s very cool of you to offer them at wholesale prices and if that option was in my proximity then I’d like to give home-roasting a try.,hxvrfe2,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sxzd6m/why_not_sell_green_beans/hxxaenq/'

Does this communicate something about the coffee itself?,When this happens on “roasted 8-24 hours ago” coffee it usually means underdevelopment. Here its just a little old or some kind of mechanical interference (vibration bumping the bowl not enough agitation on the pour etc)  We don’t tend to cup anything in the traditional format more than 72 hours old and usually in the first 24 hours. After that it usually makes more sense to our use-case to just do pourovers for evaluation,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/soh9re/whats_going_on_with_the_third_cupping_bowl_the/hw8ybmr/'

Does this communicate something about the coffee itself?,I’ve noticed that higher altitude coffees tend to have this issue at the same grind size as other lower altitude coffees in the same cupping. The idea is that when coffees grow higher in altitude they have to grow more densely to survive and they retain the density trait after roasting so they react differently than lower altitude counterparts in identical setups and will sink or just fail to bond and form the crust. I use the breaking apart as an indicator of altitude of growth which also tells me to expect more sugar content.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/soh9re/whats_going_on_with_the_third_cupping_bowl_the/hwbj090/'

I don’t remember how many days off roast the sample was but every other sample formed a crust. Usually not forming a crust means something went wrong during the roasting or cupping process but I think sometimes it’s just the coffee 🤷‍♂️. Roasting and cupping rules are just best practices.

Does this communicate something about the coffee itself?,Vibrant acidity on the cupping table could also be the result of a faster roast which tends to sink in the bowl.  It’s more of a caution than a problem. If I see grinds sinking I have to wonder if I have an under developed coffee on my hands but that usually shows up with a more astringent finish like the parchment of a roasted peanut or under ripe banann,hw8uxjk,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/soh9re/whats_going_on_with_the_third_cupping_bowl_the/hw92fn7/'

hw5iefh,2022-02-08 16:40:57,Oly-SF-Redwood,snouzj,Cold brew alternatives,this is probably not what you wanna hear but i’m gonna give my advice. If I were you I would buy lower quality coffee to cold brew. I haven’t had much cold brew that was bad tasting. Worst I get from cheap beans cold brewed is weak flavor but never liked hot coffee which to me is undrinkable if i don’t like the taste.   With my caffeine dependency bulk coffee cold brewed with almond milk is way cheaper than buying $3 energy drinks all the time   When I buy coffee beans that have flavor notes i don’t really like I cold brew it and the new flavor profile is usually better.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/snouzj/cold_brew_alternatives/hw5iefh/'

I just very specifically wanted a bright and fruity Ethiopian that was clean and complex. I just never was able to find them or if I did theyd be baked which ruins it  for me. Otherwise Id have to order from roasters outside of my city which didnt make a lot of sense in my opinion.  Not to disparage my roaster before but their style just isnt exactly what I want. Theyve been providing us good coffee for years but I just like to have a lot of control. The feedback I gave them didnt amount to anything but that makes sense. Theyre a MUCH larger company and probably werent concerned about how a small account like us perceived things. Its all subjective anyway none of us ever agreed with the taste notes on their bags either so explaining to guests was always a bit weird. As a very small batch roaster now I think we can achieve far better consistency and hone in on the exact flavor profile I want. Were just fortunate to have the financial ability to do so now.  We have a LOT of QC protocols in place and are cupping new and current coffees constantly as well as brewing them in several different methods to ensure its coming out proper. The actual flavor notes we landed on was Strawberry Bubblegum and Lemon Snapple.  Thanks for the support!,hvv5u0d,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/slqrfq/inaugural_coffee_release_20220207/hvx851s/'

We have make-up air for better roasting reasons (not diacetyl mitigation reasons) but it definitely keeps pollutants out of the production space by forcing air up the roaster vent.

You have to be grinding huge (major market grocery) amounts for this to be a concern. You have much more risk from green coffee dust as a commercial roaster by comparison.

hub8vs1,2022-01-26 09:34:11,TheTapeDeck,sd28yz,Value proposition: How is your roast better than any other?,In reality I don’t think you can differentiate without a cup in hand.  First off. “The exact same coffee” is often not the exact same coffee at all and is never the same roast. The companies you name even on the unlikely chance they are all featuring the same origin it’s not likely the same lots and it’s definitely different character due to roast. You’ll never convey this to a novice coffee buyer without overwhelming.   With the exception of a single dark roast (because most of our coffee is not dark) we have found it better to omit roast level indicators. It’s been better to just roast where we are confident that a coffee shines and then just share flavor descriptions.   Pictures are hopeless. The closest geographic competitor to me posts lots of pictures. Little to none of it is their coffee. A talented photographer can make any coffee look appealing. And just because something is light doesn’t mean it’s not dull. Just because something is dark doesn’t mean it has body.   As far as I can say in 6 years of being open word of mouth is the only reliable path to sales… marketing kitsch can sell but the money you spend on marketing (to gun nuts or people who like cats or whatever) comes out of your bottom line and usually means lesser quality coffee.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/hub8vs1/'
hub9uwx,2022-01-26 09:39:59,uuutangnamegenerator,sd28yz,Value proposition: How is your roast better than any other?,Im also a consumer - and I make a point to try to experiment with different coffee roasters when I can while also staying within what I enjoy. To me what makes a coffee roaster worth their price is the consistency.   I KNOW that when I order from a roaster I trust:    * its going to show up on time  * EVERY bag is going to be good (tasty)  * I am going to not be deceived by tasting notes    *  the consistency of the roast is going to be good (no beans roasted way further than other beans)  I hope that the additional price I pay goes towards paying everyone in the process a livable wage.  So how do I choose a roaster to buy from? I try a single bag and if I like it another and another. The key to me is if I get a bad or even meh bag I pretty much drop the roaster from my rotation. The difficulty comes in when I try something new and I dont like it - I have to determine if its a bad batch or a good batch but maybe processed in a way I dont enjoy.   So what I would say is to try lots and see what you like. For me I value consistency super highly where I have friends who value the ability to try interesting new experimental roasts more.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/hub9uwx/'
huaosl9,2022-01-26 07:24:16,Racer1,sd28yz,Value proposition: How is your roast better than any other?,> How can I try to guess which is the best roast if I have no information on the roast process?   Its kind of difficult. While the coffees may taste similar they wont taste exactly the same as your local coffee shop. You can try asking your local shop where they get their beans from or if they have any other details on the roast i.e. temp the beans were roasted to. With any of those additional details you can try asking the other roasters and compare/find the most similar.   But again while you may get a similar flavors it wont be exactly the same as your local shop. This can be due to individual roaster philosophies timing/temp age type of roaster and even your own equipment. Best you can do is compare how your local shop roasts it and see if the other companies are as similar to that.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/huaosl9/'
hueacyz,2022-01-26 21:15:47,KCcoffeegeek,sd28yz,Value proposition: How is your roast better than any other?,I wonder if the two just listing as natural and not carbonic or anaerobic are different lots? Ive never known a roaster to shy away from more exotic sounding words on a bag in exchange for the more pedestrian natural descriptor! LOL   Problem is what you are asking is VERY subjective. Picture of the roast really wont tell you anything unless its nuked and you can see oils. Color and contrast calibration of monitors will throw this off all sorts of ways. I have an instrument that measures the roast level of coffee based on optical refraction and Ive had some coffees that measure well into the medium range but temperature-wise the roaster said was actually the lightest coffees theyve ever roasted. One mans medium is another mans dark so I dont think any of that is really useful unless the picture shows an oily pile of super dark beans. Beyond that there are SOOOOO many variables in roasting even light roasts or whatever could vary dramatically based on the rate of rise starting drum temp ending drum temp air flow etc etc etc etc.   In cases like this I actually find the descriptors to be a little bit useful. If the bag emphasizes bright and fruity notes in the description its going to lean toward a light roast more acidity and a more modern cup. If they say things like chocolate memories of sitting around the campfire... then youre probably looking at a solid medium to dark roast because the acids and fruits are all gone and now its about the roast itself mainly. So while you may differ in your perception of flavors this at least tells you some useful info in terms of the roast level and what range of flavors to expect. If you can find the farms website or the distributor for the coffee (like Cafe Imports for example) I will often take a quick look at the description and if the roaster copied and pasted the distributors or farms description of the coffee word for word thats a warning sign for me.   Score would be meaningless IMHO and the reason I dont score coffees on my review site. Some of the sites that score also charge a fair amount of money so there is a conflict of interest to some extent there.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/hueacyz/'

Of course it is not the same roast if I was to expect all roasts are the same I would buy the cheapest and move on. I was hoping to find any information that could help me to understand which is the point you find the coffee to shine or vaguely how do you think your roast makes it to shine.  The photos can lie certainly but so can the flavor description isnt it?  I find the photos of the [whiterosecoffeeroasters.co.uk](https://whiterosecoffeeroasters.co.uk) useful and the coffee I buy looks like the in the photo.  Thank you again for your response.

If they BS the bag description the buyer is going to be unhappy and why would a roaster want to shoot themselves in the foot? Bag descriptions are already problematic as the people writing them are either: 1) Copying/pasting from the farms or distributors website or 2) Taste way more coffee way more intentionally than the average consumer and have a more developed and better trained palate or 3) Are using cupping notes from seasoned cuppers who may cup dozens of coffees every day for a living. And whats in the cupping notes is often not the same as a brewed cup. All this to say that people will buy a bag and expect say blueberry flavored coffee from a natural Ethiopian and not understand its a tone not a flavoring additive.,hubdbb1,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/hueathc/'

I just answered your point about pictures being manipulated or not even from the coffee.  My point is not that roasters lie is that I would like them to be able to communicate their roasting work.  For me a picture of the beans is easier to verify when I receive the beans than taste notes that as you say I may not be trained to detect.  My question is why should I value your work and buy online from your business instead of going to the closes coffee shop taste their coffee and get their single origin I like the most. If that is the only way to appreciate what is the added value of the roast the big chains of coffee will probably get most of rosters out of business the day give 2 steps in the specialty coffee direction.  I am not asking much.

hufoipy,2022-01-27 06:23:04,KCcoffeegeek,sd28yz,Value proposition: How is your roast better than any other?,What I’m saying is that this is a sensory experience and so the info is going to be subjective whether it’s a photo a description of a roast level etc. You answered your own question really and that is if you aren’t willing to take a little bit of a gamble then your best bet IS to buy something local that you’ve tasted and you know you like.,hueppd2,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/hufoipy/'

hubhprb,2022-01-26 10:26:12,R0astN00b,sd28yz,Value proposition: How is your roast better than any other?,I mean it’s fair to ask how much the beans are roasted and the roaster could choose to answer that.  IPhotos of beans might be nice to see but lighting camera lens and quality of image play a huge role in how the bean looks. Also a light roasted Kenyan will look darker than a light roasted natural yirg or a light roasted columbian depending on the varietal.   I don’t reveal level of roast to a specific temp and probably won’t reveal it unless a friend specifically asks me about it. As a roaster I choose how to roast a bean to make it shine in my opinion and that’s how I do it.,huaze5h,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/hubhprb/'
hufq4dq,2022-01-27 06:36:02,Background_Ad_842,sd28yz,Value proposition: How is your roast better than any other?,Well you say that it is useful to say chocolate and that I should read that as medium to dark roast. Why cant you say medium to dark roast as well? Isnt it less convoluted?  A description of the roast level communicates to me that you put some effort in finding the point that makes the coffee shine.  You could go as precise as giving times and temperatures.  I think my problem is that I bought in to this idea that coffee is very complex and involves a lot of technical and scientific knowledge that I expected rosters to mater. At the current state with zero information about the roast it seems to me that roaster choice is full blown gamble not a little bit of gamble.,hufoipy,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/hufq4dq/'

Im just say that as a consumer I would appreciate if you could share some information about what that means to you for that bean.

Again I don’t think this would be super useful personally as a lot of variables go into the roast curve. Based on our discussion I would say that purchasing coffee you haven’t tasted yet just isn’t your thing.

hubnje8,2022-01-26 11:00:05,TheTapeDeck,sd28yz,Value proposition: How is your roast better than any other?,I wonder how much output this farm had. With more strident processes and surely for fruity coffee in areas not known for it I would expect a small lot. I would expect to see lots of roasters have the same regional blends Genuine Origin offerings… certain Ethiopian offerings etc. But it’s wild to me to see that one coffee in so many places. I suppose that also happens when something is offered in small bags at a particularly high price. But no idea here.,hubkfl3,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sd28yz/value_proposition_how_is_your_roast_better_than/hubnje8/'

What would you expect out of someone who approached your Coffee business with this title?,Well...that could take me days to type up to be honest but just in general some of the companies I was interviewing with for production manager before I had this idea were doing around 300k pounds roasted a year and they had plans to get to a million within a year with no prior experience. In ten years time Ive gone from 15 to 30 million a year to averaging 80. That is a massive increase. Them going from 300k to 1 million will have similar issues and Ive most likely seen them all albeit on a much larger scale.   My biggest gift I believe is Ive also seen so much growth so fast and been in every corner of the business so Ive been lucky enough to learn what not to do and Ive learned from it. Which is sadly more than I can say for most people when companies get to a large enough size. Learning what not to do and most importantly how not to treat people is where I think I will stand out most importantly. There has honestly never been a situation I could not find a solution for in the past 15 years where I needed to lose my dignity or destroy someone elses in the process and that seems to not always be the case in corporate life.,hty7mwp,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sb26q4/what_do_you_think_of_when_you_hear_the_words/htycmhh/'

What would you expect out of someone who approached your Coffee business with this title?,This idea really came from my resume being out there for the past year and companies seeing everything Ive done for the last 15 years and offering me significant management positions. However when I go for the interview while the companies intentions are great its clear they have no identity. They have no idea how to market to see themselves as their own customers do. Theyve been stuck where they are for decades. And even though the offers are for management I see myself getting stuck again and being right back to where I started.  Ill give you for instance the company Im reviewing just for this idea of consulting. Its one of the 4 oldest coffee companies in the United States. It just so happens to be 20 minutes from my home. Just going off of their website they are an absolute mess. They have 2 different websites in 1. There is about 400 pieces of coffee information on the very first page. And after taking the time to go through all of both sites which included a failed podcast not once did I ever see any of their product. I as the customer have no idea what their coffee even looks like. Without even walking into their building I can tell you they need to choose a path choose an identity and hire someone to redo their first website and get rid of the second one. Ill bet all fo you that those problems I saw on the sites follow right through into the company as well...its a family run company.  Ive seen this before. If I were to come in as a manager maybe I could help a little here and there but it would take a long time. As a consultant Id be there for 1 to 5 years and i could get right to it every day. Heres what we need to do to address the problem. And if I get the dreaded...  Thats not how we do things here.  Ok. So I start looking for the next challenge.,htys9cd,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/sb26q4/what_do_you_think_of_when_you_hear_the_words/hu18gdd/'

htezy4a,2022-01-19 21:15:05,sanetorr,s7ju27,Home Roaster from India.,Woah!! Great to hear your story.  India has unfolded into predominantly a milk drinking nation partially due to the chai culture. Tea (or as we call it chai) is still a preferred beverage along with your breakfast in the northern parts of India.  Folks from the southern part of India prefer having coffee (usually robusta) mixed with chicory as their morning brew. Ofcourse with milk and sugar.  Even today majority of the 85+ coffee is exported to bigger coffee players of the west. However the specialty coffee culture of India is gradually evolving with young professionals bringing in the coffee culture from the west.   Noticable players like Blue Tokai (https://bluetokaicoffee.com/) and Subko (https://www.subko.coffee/) are folks coming down from the United States to explore and enhance the coffee culture of India.  There are a lot of artisanal roasters popping up and thats supporting the local farming community as they get more indentity and recognition that they right fully deserve.  Hope that helps.  P.S. I have no affiliation with the Coffee companies mentioned in the post.

hsfo1gz,2022-01-12 19:28:52,,s2mpel,Anyone with experience pre-grinding coffee for friends/retail/grocery stores? How do you choose what grind to use?,You need to ask your fiends how they drink their coffee.  If they have an espresso machine then the grind will be quite fine as the espresso machine forces water through the grinds.  If they use a drip machine/pour over then the grind needs to be quite coarse as the hot water stays in contact with the coffee much longer. Bigger grind larger surface area.  Your specific grinder should have a manual that tells you what setting you need for each of those options.  Bitter coffee most always is a product of roasting (too much) rather than the bean.  PS. I’d imagine most people are preparing drip coffee.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/s2mpel/anyone_with_experience_pregrinding_coffee_for/hsfo1gz/'

hsbj9ey,2022-01-11 23:57:26,TheTapeDeck,s1zcbg,starting to roast soon (questions),There are no rules—there are results. A fluid bed machine yields different results than a drum. Some more modern machines blur the lines more (I’m referring to thinks that cost more than $30k not devices that most folks start off with.)  Almost all roasting is a blend of both conduction and convection. All commercial roasting is more convective than conductive.   You will now shortly get pulled into people’s deeply subjective and flawed arguments of why X is better than y. I would encourage you to decide which method to learn based on what coffee tastes best to you and what it was roasted on rather than dogma related to what people buy and insist is great.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/s1zcbg/starting_to_roast_soon_questions/hsbj9ey/'

hsf620a,2022-01-12 17:09:02,ftrlvb,s1zcbg,starting to roast soon (questions),true commercial roasters work differently because of the amount of beans.   (most of them cant even touch the drum as they are burried in billions of other beans)  and this brings me to the size of a roaster. I guess if its a sample roaster (mini-home-roaster) it will always roast differently than a lets say 3kg roaster. so the size alone is a huge factor as well. I just want to make sure even I build a small one to make it a very capable roaster with good adjustment features that actually work.,hsbj9ey,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/s1zcbg/starting_to_roast_soon_questions/hsf620a/'

hqtormb,2022-01-01 10:17:08,danthenatureman,rtlvhs,Buying direct from producers,The Import/Export business is fairly complex and is Not something that I would recommend trying on your own. Assuming that you want to purchase a large quantity build a relationship with an importer in your country. Sometimes they will help you broker a deal directly with the producer and then manage the logistics for you. If you want a smaller quantity you’re probably out of luck unless you visit the country of origin and find a farmer that will sell you a small amount.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rtlvhs/buying_direct_from_producers/hqtormb/'
hquqlqa,2022-01-01 14:35:59,IdrinkSIMPATICO,rtlvhs,Buying direct from producers,Our first 5 years in business we imported directly from growers in Oaxaca. We ran into a multitude of problems. The first year commodity prices went crazy and so they only honored half of our contract. Second and third year went fine. Forth year we only received half the weight of our contract and it took 6 months of hard work for them to redeem the difference. Fifth year our entire load was delayed by three months. Every year there was some hang up at the border.  We now purchase coffee from the same growers now but pay a major coffee import and logistics company to handle everything. It’s been a flawless situation for the last 6 years and everybody is happy. My anecdotal advice is pick what you are good at in the coffee industry and focus on your strengths.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rtlvhs/buying_direct_from_producers/hquqlqa/'

The industry definitely isnt keeping up with pay standards.   That said I like the owners set my own schedule etc so Ive stayed here longer than I probably shouldve. If I was okay with something more structured I could be making $20-28 working on a production line or making significantly more bartending but dont want that amount of exposure due to covid.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/hpq7rhz/'
hpqad8y,2021-12-23 14:19:17,weagle01,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,Independent coffee shops/roasters aren’t making much money so there’s not excess margin that could go to staff. Unless someone else knows something I haven’t figured out yet! My GM makes more money than I do. Prices for coffee need to go up dramatically and I don’t think there’s a big enough market of people willing to pay those prices.

hpqvzah,2021-12-23 17:02:38,traveler19395,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,Like many businesses roasters and cafes already pay a huge portion of their gross to labor costs even when its only $10-15/hr.  And theyre very rarely making big profits where you can argue the owners should be sharing more with the employees.    Theres only two real ways to change that 1. charge a lot more for coffee or 2. automate most of the jobs and pay more to the few people left.  If a cafe charges a lot more for coffee in order to pay their employees a nice living wage most people will just go down the street to the cheaper cafe they already consider a $4 latte expensive *very few* will pay double.  If they automate a lot of the jobs the few positions left will be the skilled labor who can maintain the robots and the best performative baristas that can make it feel personable like people are used to despite most the labor being automated.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/hpqvzah/'
hpq2axw,2021-12-23 13:20:58,milopalmer,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,I’d guess this is related to the size of the company and the profit margin of the product.

htz05py,2022-01-23 20:16:18,theeclecticmayhem,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,Ok so here is a different take.  I had been a part of a Coffee company that went from a successful yet small family run company and within 10 to 15 years was doing 80 million pounds of roasted coffee a year and had become part of a global corporation.   We were more than successful every single year and broke records every single year. Some people became very rich and were promoted numerous times. Some parts of the company grew in leaps and bounds.   The original base of operations. The roasters. The grinders. The extractors. The floor employees. These people saw their lives stay frozen in time as if nothing had ever changed. Barely getting 1 and 2% cost of living yearly increases as the company made hundreds of millions of dollars year after year. Even employees who learned new positions skills etc were told they would become more valuable if they were to do so but would never be compensated and never promoted.  This whole time the whole 15 years there was always more money than anyone knew what to do with. There was opportunity for everyone. There was nothing but potential. But the foundation wasnt protected.  Instead of spending the money building up the foundation protecting it and reinforcing it for years to come the company spent hundreds of millions of dollars on big time gambles. Big time gambles that all failed.   15 years later the sure thing the cash cow that was easy money is now struggling to make it by and if ruins compared to how it used to be because of excess and mismanagement.    There is money in coffee. There is big money in coffee. There is so much potential in coffee. The problem is when a company gets to a real competition level they get bought out by idiots like this who ruin all the potential for everyone by being greedy and not sticking to the basics.   Coffee works because its easy. You try to make it too complicated and thats where you start to lose people. Quality green bean and a simple roasting process. They just couldnt get that and now...well theyre broke lol.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/htz05py/'
hpqba7l,2021-12-23 14:25:49,HeyimShae,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,Do you feel that is sustainable for you long term? Not necessarily in your case but for many I know that the owners take advantage of similar positions. For example banking on paying employees under market value by offering benefits like “make your own schedule” and “the opportunity to go to origin and represent us at expo.” Taking advantage of creative types who will work really hard and be content because they love coffee.  The reason I moved on from coffee is that it wasn’t sustainable long term for me. Too hard on my body with very little benefit. I had a feeling the job could cause medical bills that the wages couldn’t cover. Free coffee and the occasional pizza day only goes so far. The money in coffee was laughable teetering the poverty line where I live. At one point I was making $17.50 an hour in the Bay Area for a highly skilled job with 3 years experience minimum. That’s barely enough to rent a small room with a shared bathroom.   In my experience owners know this and work hard to take advantage of employees who are okay with it. Doing everything in their power to keep good talent without paying them more.  This of course does not apply to every situation and specifically not all roaster/retailers outside of the US. I don’t have as much experience with professionals outside the US but from the industry folks I keep in contact with from Australia they are paid very differently there.,hpq7rhz,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/hpqba7l/'
hpqcxjs,2021-12-23 14:37:48,HeyimShae,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,That’s very true and you’re hitting on the most important point I think.   The average consumer has no idea where their coffee is coming from and the amount of labor involved. From the producer to the roaster so many people touch each and every coffee.   Coffee isn’t like other agg products it’s substantially more complex and involved. Many employees at the roaster level are under compensated but at the farmer level…farm workers are absolutely impoverished. Roasters need to work together to properly educate consumers and somehow influence the market to find avenues for greater revenue.   Competition in the industry is at an all time high and expansion is difficult nearly impossible the last couple of years.  My heart goes out to small business owners in the industry having the challenge of staying afloat while also compensating employees fairly.   In my mind fair isn’t what’s considered industry standard. Fair is what is required to live a dignified life without fear of bankruptcy from a medical accident or living under the threat of looming homelessness. As a business we have an equal responsibility to our customers and our employees. In the US a business functions not only as a vessel of wealth building for the owner but also as a means for dignified livelihood for the employees. That’s what a top-down capitalist economy is for trickle it down to empower the employees. Although we all know that’s not how it is always works in practice.,hpqad8y,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/hpqcxjs/'
hprqy69,2021-12-23 21:14:36,TheTapeDeck,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,There is nothing left at the end to share. We would need to make another $0.75 per drink and another $3 or so per bag to be able to break the $20/hour mark. This isn’t a nut that’s going to be cracked by small business… it’s the kind of thing that SB unionization could help. When their prices crank up it’d be easier for everyone to follow suit.,hpqvzah,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/hprqy69/'
hpq700d,2021-12-23 13:54:58,HeyimShae,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,Size of company definitely matters. Even large roasters are guilty of low wages for skilled labor. I would say Starbucks is the exception not the rule for large organizations. Starbucks also has the most rigorous hiring process in the industry as well as the highest expectations for talent. Their jobs often require a minimum of 5 years of experience with a proven track record of stellar performance. They are known to poach top talent from all other industries and pay for the talent too.,hpq2axw,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/hpq700d/'
hpsewze,2021-12-24 01:38:55,HeyimShae,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,The 75k role is for a director level position which requires years of experience. It’s the kind of job that directly impacts the success of the business in a major way. It’s also in one of the most expensive places in the country. On a single income 75k in this part of the country will get you a decent apartment and not much more. With an average home price just below 900k and an equally high cost of living this job posting is basically asking someone to take less than half the money & benefits they would make elsewhere for the opportunity to work at a “cool” roaster.   It has nothing to do with 75k being a lot or little of money it’s about the statement the industry is making with a job posting like that.,hprqiep,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/hpsewze/'
hpqervg,2021-12-23 14:51:19,thatjacob,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,Its not sustainable for the long term but its been okay the past few years. I live between two states (dating someone who moved for grad school) and regularly commute an hour and a half so the ability to make my own schedule and be late when needed is huge. Plus our rent is $550 for a 2 bedroom apartment so cost of living is low enough to scrape by. It works for the moment but I hope not to work in coffee after our next move if that says anything.,hpqba7l,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rn3jto/coffee_industry_compensation_discussion/hpqervg/'
hpqirs6,2021-12-23 15:20:50,milopalmer,rn3jto,Coffee Industry Compensation Discussion,Yes Starbucks is exceptional in the coffee sector but pretty typical for a big company.

We tend to roast washed/honey south/central American coffee and we do a medium and dark roast each month. So profiles tend to be more or less similar and fairly easy to roast so that is what my comments refer to as far as experience.   I asked Rob Hoos his opinion on doing just this and he was confident in saying that as long as you match up the coffee roasting events that you will have the same results. If you are hitting color change 1st crack and endpoint at the same times on both roasters youll have the same coffee.   IME this seems to be true or true enough at least for what we do. I have a few profiles on the Ikawa that generally line up with my production roasting targets like 9 minutes to 1st crack and 1:30 development. Curves between these points dont look exactly the same so I guess technically they are not exactly the same. The Ikawa holds a linear line between points defined on the roasting profile (based on return temp) whereas the Loring has a more natural analog line (assume some logarithmic function).  The only thing that I am not certain of between the roasters is final temp. Since Ikawa has only return temp and different sensors than the Lorning that one is a bit of a guess. But again in IME what I taste from the Ikawa and the Loring are very similar when the events line up so I dont over think it.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rk6ovt/ikawa_and_loring_anyone_have_experience_sample/hp883jg/'

I am considering an Ikawa and would appreciate some insight on the matter. Thanks,It seems to me like they would never truly be the same finished product since one is pretty much all convective and the other one tumbles more drum-like. But also I’d sort of expect the Loring coffee to always be better. And that’s where youre going to make all your batch by batch tweaks… like “this coffee is excellent but I wonder if I can bring out more of the xyz” is not something youre going to port from a little sample tool to a big commercial roaster—those are all things you have to work out on the big one.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rk6ovt/ikawa_and_loring_anyone_have_experience_sample/hp8n7q9/'

In the Ikawa beans are roasted in the metallic chamber swirling and frequently in direct contact with the sides (if not bottom)  which is more or less the same as a drum. The difference that you will taste IMHO is in the different controls and measurements you have to rely on.

So much so actually that I find it pretty boring to use. Define the profile let it run once twice hundred times does exactly the same thing. I roast full manual on the Loring and as I am sure you know different coffees need different gas management. The Loring (as my wife says) is the F1 race car of roasters and it reacts so fast to changes it is such a pleasure to roast on. The Ikawa the roasting experience is very sterile.

I am considering an Ikawa and would appreciate some insight on the matter. Thanks,I meant Loring vs Ikawa. Both have metallic chambers and will heat the bean with convection + conduction. Although I would assume primarily convection on both and to varying degrees of conduction between the roasters. So when I say drum I dont mean drum roaster I mean the drum of the Loring.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dst4AfaAiH0&t=36s        A popcorn popper and say my old FreshRoast the beans are less frequently in contact with the sides so limited conduction. In Ikawa beans swirl the chamber due to air flow but def more in contact than the FR or popcorn popper.        Have not scientifically determined any of this but seems like an easy guess.,hpctqho,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rk6ovt/ikawa_and_loring_anyone_have_experience_sample/hpcx2i6/'

hoxlzir,2021-12-17 09:14:47,Indigo_Mockingbird,riilza,Has anyone tried Geisha beans? Any recommendations?,I get mine from Sweet Marias. The first time I ever had gesha was when I was working at a cafe distributor and some came into our possession back in 2012. It was still fairly uncommon then so it was pretty exciting. I still remember how excited the whole warehouse got every day for the cupping sessions. We would all stop whatever we were doing and all cup it together.   I roast it pretty regularly as its one of my favorites. Its super bright if you can keep your RoR pretty aggressive and develop the acidity. Theres a tent interesting flavor that is unique to gesha kind of a tangy tartness that I think is just wonderful. It blends great with other beans and makes one hell of a puckering espresso thatll kick you in the ass too.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/riilza/has_anyone_tried_geisha_beans_any_recommendations/hoxlzir/'

hoxo4a9,2021-12-17 09:28:17,TheTapeDeck,riilza,Has anyone tried Geisha beans? Any recommendations?,I REALLY do not think theres a tartness as a result of variety as opposed to origin conditions and how you roast it. I’ve done a couple dozen Gesha coffees across price ranges and “scored” middle 80s to low 90s. There are no more unifying flavor characteristics among these coffees in my shop than there are of bourbon grown all over the planet. That youve gotten bright results out of Gesha IMO just means that the Gesha youve roasted has brightness to explore. Weve had some that was RUINED by aggressive roasts and some that could only taste good as a result of a fast roast. In fact I’ve experienced that with Sweet Maria’s (Coffee Shrub) offerings… one Guatemala Acatenango Gesha they offered was pretty horrid on a fast roast and fantastic when stretched an extra 2 minutes for the same drop temp.,hoxlzir,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/riilza/has_anyone_tried_geisha_beans_any_recommendations/hoxo4a9/'
hoz8whe,2021-12-17 15:41:33,siddowncheelout,riilza,Has anyone tried Geisha beans? Any recommendations?,Gotta disagree here. If you process geisha and typica side by side the geisha is going to have lighter body slightly higher acidity and an overall juicier profile.  Not to downplay processing it surely has a larger effect on cup character than varietal but different varietals definitely have innate characteristics in a vacuum.,hoxn5bt,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/riilza/has_anyone_tried_geisha_beans_any_recommendations/hoz8whe/'
hoxt3kz,2021-12-17 09:59:42,Indigo_Mockingbird,riilza,Has anyone tried Geisha beans? Any recommendations?,When I worked in distribution we went through like 5-6 coffees at a time. Cupping testing etc. I found the geshas all had a potential for that tartness if you tuned for it but there certainly a sweetness that is unique. Most of the time we only had one gesha at a time. The thing that makes it so consistent from origin to origin when compared to a bourbon is that it hasnt been subjected to the hundreds of years of trade farming and industrialization as bourbon has and certainly not to the degree bourbon has. Over time it will start to change more and more by region but for now I find it more consistent from origin to origin than your average varietal.,hoxo4a9,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/riilza/has_anyone_tried_geisha_beans_any_recommendations/hoxt3kz/'
hozezlf,2021-12-17 16:24:44,TheTapeDeck,riilza,Has anyone tried Geisha beans? Any recommendations?,Im not suggesting it tastes the same as Typica bur that theres the same spectrum of mediocre to great in most varieties of arabica. For sure varieties have differences in the cup. Its just that Gesha doesnt turn out to be that remarkable just for being Gesha. You can DEFINITELY pay $9/lb for a Costa Rica Gesha that you will score lower than a $6 Costa Rica Villa Sarchi. And then you still have to charge your customers a significant premium for a coffee that is of lower quality (in your own estimation) than something 50% less expensive.,hoz8whe,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/riilza/has_anyone_tried_geisha_beans_any_recommendations/hozezlf/'

hnrtlja,2021-12-08 14:49:44,Pieinthesky42,rbu9xt,Beginner Coffee Maker -- I need help with White Coffee,If you’re asking for help I’d start with a better opening next time. Wow that was off putting.   Are you using any hawaij? White coffee by itself isn’t the most pleasant to me. I’m not familiar with your machine but this spice is the main flavor. Look into that first as it’s an easy fix vs asking everyone to try to fix your drink on a sub dedicated to coffee roasting. If you’re wanting help with making a drink there are better subs for those questions.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rbu9xt/beginner_coffee_maker_i_need_help_with_white/hnrtlja/'
hnsbbcl,2021-12-08 16:52:59,TheTapeDeck,rbu9xt,Beginner Coffee Maker -- I need help with White Coffee,This is a roasting group. There are going to be 20 opinions on how to roast white coffee and many of them will require different extraction.  Your biggest challenge is not the espresso machine (though that is a challenge.) Its the grinder. If you don’t have a commercial grinder you will probably not grind well enough to do white coffee—instead you’d want to find a supplier of white coffee whose product you like and get them to pre-grind for you.   USUALLY white coffee is “less developed” and it’s going to be much harder to grind. It is very difficult to grind good regular espresso on most home grinders (and nearly impossible on many) and that will only be more challenging with white coffee.   It’s not a lost cause… someone out there offers the product you like and they will almost certainly be happy to grind and ship for you. But this is a coffee roasting group not a coffee drinker or espresso or coffee beverage x group. Post in r/coffee and youll get more useful ideas.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/rbu9xt/beginner_coffee_maker_i_need_help_with_white/hnsbbcl/'

hkuoipr,2021-11-16 06:43:14,Formal_Bar_8406,qv7i3y,Large batch liquid coffee,As a former coffee technician and special events coordinator I want to add that the limitations of the batch brew is the brew basket depth and the paper filter.   With a standard 13x5 filter you can brew using only 8-8.25 oz of coffee that will yield 120-123.75 fl oz of coffee (with the 15:1 ratio) a little shy of a gallon. Using a higher dose may cause the slurry to overflow the basket. If your Bunn ITCB is deep enough you may use a 15x5 and use higher doses.   Brew times with pre-wet and spray cycles will land a brew time of at least 4:30 minutes (fewer cycles short delays) but really 5:30 minutes will probably extract better. That said if you begin brewing prior to open is an option that may help. If you want to cut down on needed equipment (scales and a bulk grinder) that will take valuable workspace AND an outlet you may have to pregrind your batches and keep them in an airtight cambro.  How many people are expected?   What size cups will you serve? Using 8oz cups each gallon serves 16 cups of coffee. Using 12oz cups each gallon serves 10 cups of coffee. Using 16oz cups each gallon serves 7.5 cups of coffee?  Can a 3 gallon fetco airport fit beneath the basket of a Bunn ITCB-29?,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qv7i3y/large_batch_liquid_coffee/hkuoipr/'
hkutylz,2021-11-16 07:26:40,Aggravating-Bag4552,qv7i3y,Large batch liquid coffee,We are using 12oz cups and will be brewing offsite. Its a craft fair so 500 plus people no idea how many coffee drinkers. I may run 2- 1.5 gallon batches into the 3 gallon airpot (fits the machine like a glove). I have a bulk grinder and all the coffee for the 4hr fair will be brewed prior to the fair opening.,hkuoipr,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qv7i3y/large_batch_liquid_coffee/hkutylz/'
hkvncv2,2021-11-16 10:46:49,Formal_Bar_8406,qv7i3y,Large batch liquid coffee,Then to answer your real question lower coffee to water ratios is generally a strategy to maximize extraction and thereby providing a higher TDS %. The ease of extraction is facilitated by roast and roast development. What I mean is that  if you light roasted (Agtron 85-75ish) a high density Colombian coffee you may need to use more tactics such as lower ratios finer grinds or high temperatures to pull more deliciousness from the coffee. At medium medium + you may not really need to go 15:1 as there should be enough solubles present. A-B the  coffees with the presumed grind setting on both.,hkutylz,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qv7i3y/large_batch_liquid_coffee/hkvncv2/'

hkto0l5,2021-11-15 23:22:48,theBigDaddio,quxccr,Are air or drum roasters better?,Depends on what you want. Sonofresco Air roasters are really nice and once you get your roast down you can fully automate. they are air roasters. They use big ass air roasters at Whole Foods and other on premise roasters. Personally I prefer them. If you are just roasting for yourself look at the Freshroast 540 or 800. The 800 can roast 1/2lb (225g) and is easy to use in your kitchen.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/quxccr/are_air_or_drum_roasters_better/hkto0l5/'
hkv4hg9,2021-11-16 08:42:26,TheTapeDeck,quxccr,Are air or drum roasters better?,At the home enthusiast level of product it’s more about which brand and design you choose than which technology is used. I’ll take a Huky over anything at or below it’s price point. I’d take a Behmor over a FR800.  At the commercial level I would only ever buy a drum but some are more convective than others and can blur the line a little. I do believe that drum roasting outperforms air roasting for taste and flexibility.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/quxccr/are_air_or_drum_roasters_better/hkv4hg9/'

hkujbv1,2021-11-16 05:57:21,guitarlunn,quxccr,Are air or drum roasters better?,Yes there is a difference between drum and air. To keep it simple air roasts will almost always be brighter and cleaner tasting. Drum roasts develop more evenly and tend to have a more body overall. I have roasted both ways for a long time and enjoy air roasts the best but there is an art to getting the balance right. One caveat with air roasting is you aren’t going to get a good dark roast or roast for espresso so if that’s your thing I would go with drum style so you can control that part of the roast better.,hkugh26,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/quxccr/are_air_or_drum_roasters_better/hkujbv1/'
hkujzbo,2021-11-16 06:03:28,theBigDaddio,quxccr,Are air or drum roasters better?,I don’t have one. There are those that say they can tell but I think it’s biased. People like to say their way is best. For the money an air roaster like the SR540 or SR800 can’t be beat. If you are on a budget Sweet Maria’s has their Popper roaster bigger than popcorn machine and has control. Kieth has a number of videos on the Freshroast.  https://youtu.be/PLqHKwWnNKc  https://youtu.be/rwcjBY1Ohl8,hkughud,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/quxccr/are_air_or_drum_roasters_better/hkujzbo/'

Could it be an antenna?,Im a mechanic for an industrial roaster. Ive seen dead cockroaches in the green coffee. However only two in almost thirty years. We had a bird get into the exhaust pipe once. Ive never seen a cockroach in our equipment. Mice cockroaches and other pests dont eat coffee so theres no interest to go into a coffee plant. Theres plenty of Broca in cheaper coffee. If you like robusta coffee  there will be a small percentage of insect protein. Fortunately it is  well roasted and unrecognizable. Theres lots of animal protein in foods like ketchup for instance. Sometimes ignorance is bliss if this disturbs you.   All this said thats just a piece of roasted jute. Not harmful but a real pain in the butt to eliminate. Cleaning coffee is all about density and jute acts allot like roasted beans.

hjsiygl,2021-11-08 04:28:07,reedinrainbow,qop4h9,Coffee density measurement help.,Theres such a think as bulk density bulk tapped density which refers to the density of the collection of beans or particles.

hjtewxk,2021-11-08 09:03:19,reedinrainbow,qop4h9,Coffee density measurement help.,Sure regular old density is mass/volume but it depends on the unit you want to measure.  For powders often the density of the collection of particles is measured (powder bed) sometimes the density of an individual particle is measured.  I see the question was about the latter.  Although it seems like you might just be approximating how much water is in each bean?

These roasts help clean the drum of any residual oils from the manufacturing of the machine. This allows the beans we roast in production to retain their flavors and rather than absorb manufacturing grease and such. Throughout the hour long roast They turn quite black release tons of oils. Eventually they become so dry that they reabsorb excess oils. We do this only on a brand new roaster straight from manufacturing.,hiybpcg,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qkkwdc/breaking_in_he_new_workhorse_just_look_at_those/hiyo5hz/'

Adding stickers and custom made boxes and then boxes to ship those boxes in it’s easily got to be in that range. My generic bags plus our limited treatment of those bags is already around $0.45 per bag. Boxes for shipping etc none of this is really covered by the price we charge for shipping etc.   Even buying these coffees retail you as the customer are paying more per gram of that coffee because of the beautiful waste it’s surrounded by.

hi4ne6l,2021-10-26 09:03:08,TheTapeDeck,qg8ta1,Wholesale bean supplier recommendations?,Gen Origin is a good company. If your market will comfortably pay more for coffee there is sometimes an argument to be made for spending more on your green particularly if you have the kind of transparency access that indicates youre not just paying the importing company more.  Since youre looking at roughly half bags I would also look into LaREB (all Colombian and they do their logistics in Colombia) La Bodega which is part of Cafe Imports the way Gen Origin is part of Volcafe and Coffee Shrub. Sometimes Caravela has small box offerings.  I do order from Genuine Origin often. The people are great. The “Volcafe way” is one approach to making coffee viable.  Edit: I should point out that I have not looked up Casa Verde specifically. I was just giving my take on Gen O. They do sometimes have some high end SO type coffees available so I don’t mean to make it sound like “you should buy better coffee.” Rather that if your market can withstand the price sometimes you can do things that you know for a fact pay the producer more than just a fair small profit margin. Most growers I’ve spoken with are looking for 20-50% profit (the high end of which which is currently a pipe dream but that’s barely a subsistence wage for business on the retail end so it shouldn’t be.) An extremely complicated topic different in most every origin… but it boils down to “it is often worth it to pay more especially if you have access to farm gate info etc. Sometimes $0.30/lb makes a difference and isn’t a hardship. Looking for unique coffees that way can also help you differentiate from your local competition. But I would very much buy GO Colombia if it tastes right to you.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qg8ta1/wholesale_bean_supplier_recommendations/hi4ne6l/'

hi4li34,2021-10-26 08:50:31,realboy4real,qg45fe,Im think Im doing smth wrong based on the color of the beans... Taste is greenish vegetal. Is that a light cinammon roast?,There are too many variables to give any conclusive advice but it could just be time. Green and grassy flavors are indicative of underdeveloped roasts…HOWEVER they’re also sometimes present in coffees that need more time to rest. Some coffees roasted very light don’t taste right until they hit a week & a half off of roast. These coffees appear to be washed processed. I’d let them rest and try them 5-7 days off of roast and then evaluate from there. Some of my best washed coffees are roasted super light low and slow. Total roast time: 10-12 minutes I’ll typically let them go 45 seconds to 1.20 after first crack. And they don’t taste quite right until about a week off of roast.

hhij0k9,2021-10-21 10:25:05,bigsagebrush,qcvduy,Exhaust Ducting,This would depend entirely on the state and local codes - but if the HVAC company is asking for it theres probably a reason. With duct work (especially high temp) theres usually fire codes and clearances that need to be accounted for and depending on where you are and the height/style of ducting youre using potentially seismic considerations as well.   You could probably look all those codes up and install the ductwork correctly yourself but many local govts. will require a stamp from an ME on the books just to be safe.  When we got the process started our HVAC company had an ME they recommended and it went smoothly.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qcvduy/exhaust_ducting/hhij0k9/'

hhiv2va,2021-10-21 11:46:30,matthewrobertk,qcvduy,Exhaust Ducting,If you want the work to be permitted by the city/state yes. Its likely not going to be a quick process either. Most engineering firms are pretty backed up and a lot wont want to take on something this small at the moment. Check smaller firms. Engineering firms operate on fees they receive for doing their work and there will not be much room for fee on something like this. permitting offices also have a decent backlog going. You could also check into a design/build firm. They will have the engineers and contractors all in a one stop shop product so to speak and might be able to turn the job around quicker.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qcvduy/exhaust_ducting/hhiv2va/'

hhb0niv,2021-10-19 18:00:11,UhOhByeByeBadBoy,qbo7pl,Getting into roasting,No need to check your ego! Coffee is just fire and time. It’s just extremely nuanced and there are a lot of elements that are somewhat outside of your control so the more you can “guarantee” the better.  The only thing tough about the bullet is that you’re running electric. You can still get plenty of data points on gas roasters as well but the bullet is a little more plug and play (no gas required no 220v I assume).  I would definitely recommend not settling on something though. If you are curious or have a hunch you want something else you’ll probably always want something else.  You can also check out Showroom Coffee for a Huky 500 or Arc 800. I’m currently waiting on a sample roaster from Wintop something it’s a Santoker WS-200 for about $2500 shipped.  In general all of this is a process of elimination and learn through failure endeavor. You can definitely produce good coffee without too much trouble but creating a commercially competitive and consistent coffee is where you have to fail more and go beyond “good” and really criticize every nuance until you hate coffee,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qbo7pl/getting_into_roasting/hhb0niv/'

I too come from an analytics background and have spent over a decade on the basic Hottop model.  (a model that Ive always shared with others as the ideal entry-level for the fact that you can eject the beans from the drum which is not often found in roasters cheaper than it).  The plucky thing has served me quite well but Im as blind as a bat in terms of observing the conditions of the roast beyond time and ET.

These are easily rewired fitted with temp probes and connected to a PID and Artisan software to make a roaster that will roast to a given temp/time curve.  Rig I built cost about $600 (laptop for software not included). Had a blast planning the mods and learning. Temp is entirely PID controlled and fan is manually controlled with a dimmer.

hhbabti,2021-10-19 19:15:34,UhOhByeByeBadBoy,qbo7pl,Getting into roasting,Lol I’ve been down this road. It’s a slippery slope.  If you’re trying to sell coffee amongst peers there is a lot of regulation to do it legally. But I also know full roasting businesses that don’t abide by licensing requirements so to each their own.  I will say with as much room as there is for error I would be surprised to see the community latch on to it. I lease time at a cafe to roast commercially (I’m only a year in) and the guy I roast with is like 6 years in and still wrestling profiles and new coffees.  I also know of a small roasting operation that uses a Bullet but they’re really small. And only supply coffee for their church I think.  It’s all technically possible to do 100% but do not budget sales into your purchase haha because if you have any amount of success the first thing you’ll do is buy more equipment haha.  You can also get a propane roaster like the Huky 500 btw. The thing with electric is it’s like coasting. So the big phase to drop heat is the same stage where a lot of the flavors are developed. So to control that with electric can be frustrating but the Huky is a little clunky for my liking anyway.   I roasted with a Quest M3 for a while and I liked the results compared to my hobby roaster (SR540) but as I got more familiar with coffee I became more frustrated with its limitations.  Anyway plenty of people have been where you are now and came to a conclusion of some sort so don’t take my word for anything more than it’s worth. The bullet is a dope looking machine I would happily use one if it was my best option.,hhb8dnn,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qbo7pl/getting_into_roasting/hhbabti/'

Im in canada and there are a large number of tax rules that really would save me money if i started this as a small business.  Im not too concerned if i sell a ton of beans right out of the gate.  I want 220 in my garage for a few other reasons and the canadian tax rules allow you to write off startup costs against your primary income.  Which for me is a savings of 370$ per 1000$ of writeoffs alone.  So its a serious savings.  the machine is 4000$ canadian but i can depreciate is by 50% in the first year which is a 2000$ writeoff or nearly 700$ in savings in year 1 just for the machine.  (canadian tax law is retarded)  Theres a little community roaster about 15 mins from me that sells out of a mailbox on his fence.  I was planning something similar.  It creates the minimum startup costs and allows me to provide something nice for the community without too many costs.  but im still throwing ideas around.,hhbabti,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/qbo7pl/getting_into_roasting/hhcy0lo/'

hghjdm7,2021-10-13 07:30:07,Racer1,q750ll,Looking to start Roastery in Canada.,Not in Canada but some general advice:  * youll need to find a distributor for your greens. i know of a few stateside but since your in Canada itll make more sense to look up those so youre not paying extra importing from a US distributor * to determine roaster size try to figure out demand -- do your connections currently sell coffee and how much do they usually sell? is there a local cafe? would they be open to selling/serving your beans? how much do they sell? what about your own distribution/sales plans? some math can help you figure out rough weekly volume * on roasters - if you want to start up sooner rather than later youll need to source yourself a used roaster. take a look at the classifieds but if youre just starting out - a 5 - 12kilo roaster is a good starting point but is dependent on your volume. a roast can take anywhere from 12-20 minutes per batch so calculate out how much coffee you can pump out per hour because youll likely be standing in front of that machine (at least to start) to produce the product * have you roasted before? if not - look for a roasting class. there are a few stateside in Minneapolis (mill city) and Vermont (forget where) * also things to think about - do you want to open/run your own cafe or just focus on roasting/distributing?,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/q750ll/looking_to_start_roastery_in_canada/hghjdm7/'

I remember 2-3 years back I hopped to Toronto to attend the coffee and tea show.  Many suppliers at that show and looking for partnerships.  on top of my head i remembered cafe enrroca feature coffee beans from Honduras has some interesting greens.  I would suggest you get a small sample roaster machine first to experiment.  depends on which fuel you are going to use gas or electric.  Venting is very important.  Also rapid cooling after you obtained the degree of roast some cooling racks will be needed.  Specialty coffee association do offer some courses and aids.  I would consider buying a Agtron colour card and aroma set as you will need to know how to describe your roasts.  roasting beans is the easy part but how to describe them using a lingo that can attract buyers are the tougher part.  Then you will need to have some sort of cupping set to sample your coffee.  Whats your experiences in coffee world?     &#x200B  hmm.. after all those thought process i think these are some essentials but not limited to.  1. Agtron colour scale 2. roaster (gas or electric or wood fire...) 3. aroma identifiers 4. cupping tools (coffee machines even just a way to try your roast) 5. packaging  6. labeling  7. green bean storage and suppliers (due to covid this can get dicey these days)  the question is big I dont know how to answer concisely  I tried :D,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/q750ll/looking_to_start_roastery_in_canada/hgk5iu8/'

hgfqegw,2021-10-12 19:39:48,trewert_77,q6kwoj,[deleted by user],Water hardness affects coffee taste and extraction.   Is the sourness pleasant citrus like acidity or are you perceiving vinegar tartness?   If you’re used to having hard water extractions having the filter in place softens the water and this will definitely change the taste.   It’s difficult to switch waters to taste the difference since you’re using a super auto.   But if you’re interested and have a grinder you can grind and cup 3 samples of the same coffee beans one with tap one with distilled and one with water softened by a filter to see which taste you like/prefer. My blind taste test showed me that I prefer filtered or custom mineral water. Distilled is poor tasted worst to me.  You should always use a filter or filtered water on your machines. Prolonged use without a filter will cause scale to build up on your machines internals.   https://silverbridgecoffee.com/water-quality-affect-coffee-flavor/,hgcuraj,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/q6kwoj/deleted_by_user/hgfqegw/'

hgg93ia,2021-10-12 22:35:05,trewert_77,q6kwoj,[deleted by user],If the Fresh lemon Citrus isn’t a “bad” tart/sour taste you’re actually getting more flavor from your coffee’s acidity. Coffee acidity actually adds to the perceived sweetness of the cup. It also helps cut through milk if you’re having your milk based drinks.  I think your water hardness masked this from you. No need to tweak that settting on the Machine it’s merely there to decide the descale warning timeline. If you have soft water it’ll ask u to descale on a longer interval. If you have hard water then it’ll tell you to descale often.,hgg8jd3,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/q6kwoj/deleted_by_user/hgg93ia/'

hgmxteh,2021-10-14 10:45:51,sprodown,q67bes,Making a seasonal Winter or Holiday Blend? What are you putting in it?,I run a pretty decent volume of a Holiday Blend at a mid-sized roaster the qualitative goal is a crowd pleaser coffee that can still be appreciated by a specialty coffee person (value on sweetness & body some fruit character but trying to temper acidity to be a background element).  For a couple years the winning recipe has been a majority component washed Guat with a 20-30% natural Ethiopia. Worthwhile to spend money on a decent Guat but the Ethiopia does not need to be really exquisite. With the country diff’s usually end up spending close to the same on each component.  Business wise really want to put work into getting good value on the coffees and have it be one of the higher margin offerings. People are willing to spend an extra dollar for a holiday coffee (or MSRP it higher then put it on promo). Especially helpful to bolster the bottom line at the end of the year before bonus season.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/q67bes/making_a_seasonal_winter_or_holiday_blend_what/hgmxteh/'

I’ve been experimenting with something I’ve been calling Spectrum Roasting/Blends. I take a single origin or two complimentary coffees and roast each in three (or more depending) batches: from cinnamon city city+ to full city. then I blend them back together so you  get the entire spectrum of each coffee. if I’m doing a 50/50 it’s usually a Central or South American as a base (I like chocolaty Mexicos for this) against something fruited like a washed Ethiopian. everyone I’ve given these blends or “blends” to seems to really like them. and I’d like to think they stand out from the usual approach,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/q67bes/making_a_seasonal_winter_or_holiday_blend_what/hgaymnz/'

The margins on coffee are far slimmer than they appear to folks on the outside. It is a monumental achievement to replace even a basic entry level income from most professional fields. To buy coffee ship it to someone to white label for you and then to market it in a way that someone is going to buy from “Joe New Guy who doesn’t really roast doesn’t add any value to the chain doesn’t have a name to trade on” instead of buying from established sources that already cut the margin arguably too thin (I.e. can match your quality AND beat your price) or are award winning roasters or big hype famous etc.  This is a much much harder thing to win with than just opening a damn brick and mortar cafe and recognizing youre never going to earn much more than $20/hour ever again.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pzao94/coffee_roasting_manufactured_dropshipped/hf040an/'

hf0789w,2021-10-01 11:35:26,Drakoala,pzao94,Coffee Roasting + Manufactured + Dropshipped?,I believe I understand what youre describing. My two cents is that coffee is not a friendly space for dropshipping.  On one hand consumers that enjoy fresh third-wave-esque coffee are going to want it from roasters that care about their craft and have dedicated years to honing roast profiles. The roasters that cater to the specialty craft coffee market are already selling direct to their customers. Why would a roaster go through a middleman at wholesale prices when they can pull larger margins at retail prices for a market they already service? Similarly why would their customers buy from a distributor when they can get their coffee sooner from the roaster?  On the other hand youll have consumers who want decent flavor but wouldnt consider themselves connoisseurs and arent keen on paying $20 per 12oz bags. These consumers might still regularly buy commodity coffee (grocery store shelved beans i.e. Folgers Peets etc). Why buy your re-distributed coffee when they can purchase similar tasting coffee for less elsewhere?  I certainly dont mean to gatekeep here but as others have said this is a very competitive saturated market where the trend is towards quality. The roasters capable of producing the quality of coffee youd need to sell - at the markup required for this business model - are already selling it.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pzao94/coffee_roasting_manufactured_dropshipped/hf0789w/'

All I’ve seen limit you to their selection of coffees but you can use them to make custom blends.   It’s an incredibly competitive marketplace and to be successful with a private label is essentially an exercise in marketing reach and ability.

hezom1w,2021-10-01 09:21:41,choffmasterlumpus,pzao94,Coffee Roasting + Manufactured + Dropshipped?,Absolutely hear you and agree. Ive noted that the coffee industry seems to be very oversaturated and competitive it is a commodity. This venture is to learn more about coffee roasting (something I can find myself becoming passionate about) and more of a hobby than anything at first if it turns into something bigger splendid!  The term coffee is searched 5 million times a month the only way I see and have seen anyone succeeding at selling a commodity such as coffee they have to differentiate themselves. That is done by proper (and sometimes polarizing) branding and marketing. I can learn fairly easily how to market and brand a coffee company Ive worked with multiple companies and my own on marketing and branding so I have experience there. I just wanted to come on here to see if there were any kind veteran roasters for a bit of insight and advice on how the process should or might go.,hezm9h8,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pzao94/coffee_roasting_manufactured_dropshipped/hezom1w/'

hf0abjs,2021-10-01 11:57:58,choffmasterlumpus,pzao94,Coffee Roasting + Manufactured + Dropshipped?,Those are some variables I hadnt accounted for so thanks for that. I was envisioning somewhere in the future with this project that if I were to find a flexible and quality roaster and/or distributor that I could get into more specialty coffees. If possible mixing collagen or mushroom blends into the coffee blends similarly to Four Sigmatic or Mud/WTR (not coffee but their branding is great and they market like a coffee brand).  Even if I didnt get into specialty coffee that deep and was just adding tastes like vanilla or hazelnut. I look at a coffee company such as Black Rifle Coffee which has a mix of roasts but nothing too crazy. They generate about 100M in revenue just from e-commerce they can credit the majority of that revenue to their brand image and online presence which theyve done a wonderful job building. People look at their brand rather than just coffee... That would be my intent with something like this.,hf0789w,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pzao94/coffee_roasting_manufactured_dropshipped/hf0abjs/'

hf095f1,2021-10-01 11:49:29,TheTapeDeck,pzao94,Coffee Roasting + Manufactured + Dropshipped?,The thing is let’s be clear. I agree with those “it won’t work bro” people. I’m just using the words.   What you need to remember for yourself is that you will lose ~15-20% of coffee green weight in roasting. Once roasted it is only considered fresh by the specialty market for at most 2 weeks and many customers would be pissed to get 1 week old coffee even by mail order. The total roasted cost of the coffee is not the green coffee minus the loss. It’s also the cost of roasting and packaging… and if youre selling direct to consumer also the boxing labor shipping labels and shipping cost much of which the industry tends to discount (I.e. free shipping with 2 bags or “$5 shipping any quantity.”) GOOD coffee is usually going to cost you more than $4 per bag to produce. Toll roasting white labeling add $2 per bag. Youre over $6 before you have picked up the coffee to ship it and before you’ve paid for boxes and your time to ship… going to outsource that as well? Youll pay more. Want to compete on QUALITY? YOU specifically can’t do this. You have years to put in to be better than the average roaster you compete with. Want to compete on PRICE? There are already roasters who can get coffee to grocers for less than it costs you to get the coffee roasted. The million dollar roasting plants that puke out 10k# per day… don’t want to compete with them? So youre aiming for the specialty market. Unfortunately now your consumer is pretty well informed. The cheapskates that insist “I should get my coffee for $10-12 per bag” know how to find that and besides your margins are leaving you less than $4 per bag often at this point. You have to ship 100 bags in a day to replace what you could make in a basic bitch IT gig that day. More likely youre making less than minimum wage. Want to compete on the high end? Why am I spending $20-30 on a bag of your coffee? Are you going to make up a bunch of total fabrication that establishes you as a self proclaimed big deal in coffee? Because when that collapses youre ruined… if not… really why would I buy from you instead of GGET SEY ONYX etc?   If you were a roaster like a local roaster you have a reason why someone would buy from you instead of those big names. The reason people buy from me instead of the biggest names in my region or nationally. But I trade on actual quality as a result of years of work (that nearly anyone can put in but you do not make money.) I have a brick and mortar and surprise that’s where most of the money comes from for us.   There is such little margin in this industry and there are so many people who have everything you have in terms of marketing and technical know how and salesperson skills but ALSO have the love for the coffee supply chain and have put in the work… if I were a betting man I would put my money on them every time over everyone who does some napkin math and thinks theyre going to go coffee biz full time and be their own boss.

hf0hgyq,2021-10-01 12:50:44,TheTapeDeck,pzao94,Coffee Roasting + Manufactured + Dropshipped?,If my livelihood were based on this I’d be screwed. I’m hoping to build it to the point where that’s feasible. But for the first 4 years I was working full time outside of coffee. Since COVID weve just absorbed the income loss at home and I’m only doing coffee but that’s not a permanent situation. We will either expand to make more full time jobs or I will leave the company (one less mouth to feed) and pivot.   I guess this is one of those things where you can make hobby money seemingly easily as you don’t weigh in the hours and hours at farmers markets etc… people walking with $500 feeling on top of the world not realizing they put in 50 hours to make that.  I think wholesale coffee in an underserved area is viable as a business. But most areas are well covered these days. I think retail coffee at a brick and mortar cafe is viable if the population density can support it. But I’ve been active on internet coffee and coffee business groups long enough to see a lot of people buy in and then fire-sale everything off when they realize theyre screwed. I don’t think there’s enough $ fat in this business to come in as more of a puppet master unless you come in REALLY STRONG. And that’s more risk than most people can afford. 20 minutes from my home there’s a millionaire who did a 2 mil cafe buildout as a showpiece. If I came in with $60k to try to make the mark he made I’d be swallowed whole. Instead we just focused on local and worked our way into the black.,hf0cw1y,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pzao94/coffee_roasting_manufactured_dropshipped/hf0hgyq/'

It is hard to replace a professional income with a cafe or roastery. You will work twice as many hours for less than half of what I was making in IT.  Don’t cheap out on your batch brewer espresso machine or grinders. Don’t cheap out on the amount of behind-bar space you allow. And maybe most importantly don’t even start if you aren’t prepared to sort your water perfectly. You may need RO and remineralization you may just need a 3 stage filter. You do need more than a Home Depot carbon filter.  If you can’t survive a year at minimum wage this is a dangerous prospect.

It would be a terrible idea to spend all that money to start your cafe and discover you hate making coffee.

hdjdhhm,2021-09-19 18:25:11,Jim113102,pri0qp,I got my first Express coffee maker,Go ahead and try to pull a shot 1-2 ratio. In 28-30 secs from pump start and see if you can get there.  I’ve dialed in 3 Breville machines and had the smart grinder. They come out of the box set too corse. You need to take the burr out and turn the spring to a finer setting. Then you can make micro adjustments in the correct range. You can find videos on YouTube. (The 2-1 ratio in 28-30 secs is not a “rule”. Dependent on your preference the machine and beans. Just good to get there first). good luck!   https://youtu.be/QNvOcE4-VEo,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pri0qp/i_got_my_first_express_coffee_maker/hdjdhhm/'

hcrord7,2021-09-13 18:56:54,regulus314,pnqmg6,How to rotate beans for use,Dont freeze if you dont exactly know how coffee freezing works. It will likely just ruin your coffees. Coffees that came from the freezer should never be put in room temp.        Check your sales forecast first so you know how many kilograms will you be needing for the start of the week and alot some extra bags too for emergencies. You can either purchase weekly or every two weeks. I suggest the latter option if youre gonna buy fresh from roasts so the coffee can degas properly especially for espressos. If you wanna partner with them ask if they have a wholesale account then let them help you on your purchases. I mean its part of a roasting company to help you.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pnqmg6/how_to_rotate_beans_for_use/hcrord7/'

The roastery I work for provides support for our customers during their first 4 weeks of trade with weekly orders and so they can find their feet/weekly volume and then after that we can help them order by knowing their own customer base and encouraging them to order enough for a weeks trade plus an extra bag or two on hand to let your freshest coffee “rest”,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pnqmg6/how_to_rotate_beans_for_use/hcsirnc/'
hd7jwlm,2021-09-17 07:14:04,fosterthepensioners,pnqmg6,How to rotate beans for use,Thank you. I have a Breville Pro at home but I have always struggled to dial in my beans. Maybe its the grinder (heard they arent the best) or maybe its a combination of factors. Obviously I should be getting through 1-2kg a day when operating commercially so maybe Im overthinking it too much because Im taking more than a week to go through 250g bags at home and theyre airing too much. (Using zip bags but have been looking at air tight containers used by baristas.)  My new setup (Fracino and bespoke grinder) is arriving in a few weeks so Ill definitely be liaising between the manufacturer and the roaster about how best to store and manage my bean-flow. Albeit its a bit weird that my local roaster suggested to freeze my beans when everyone here is saying not to? He didnt specifically say freeze only for home use but i imagine thats what he meant. Could freezing them be affecting my espresso significantly? Im letting them get to room temp over 24-48 hours before opening.,hcsirnc,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pnqmg6/how_to_rotate_beans_for_use/hd7jwlm/'

Sorry thats just the usual case but it might be different for you I hope. But put my pessimistic opinion aside I really recommend you to start with an Ikawa. Its great for consistent roasting and you dont need to be in front of it all the time to make sure its working as it should. i imagine you could easily roast up to **6kg per day.** Which is about **27 half-pound bags of coffee**.

hbxen86,2021-09-07 06:16:41,UhOhByeByeBadBoy,pjf2ys,Machines for roasting,Quest M3 is an alright option. There’s also a HotTop 2k+ or something that has a digital output for logging.  Also check out the Arc 800 roaster or Huky 500 from Showroom Coffee of you want to mess with gas which more or less offers better control.  I’m general you’re looking at around $3000-$5000 for something that roasts less than a pound. For the 1-3 kilo machines you’re looking at $12000-$18000.  Additionally depending on state you’re going to have different regulations on what you can sell so it’s always worth contacting your department of agriculture to find out about cottage food laws and if you don’t fall under that it’s likely food processing or light industrial zoning which has a laundry list of expectations.  Buckeye Roasters offer cheaper alternatives but I have no estimation on their value or ability.   Coffeetec.com has a lot of used roasters and pricing available if you look there you can get the gist of prices. Milk City Roasters also have their prices listed.  Diedrich 2.5k roaster is like $16000 new. SF-6 is like $20000+ I believe. Giesen 6 are like $28000 new similar for Probat (I think).  There’s also the Aillio Bullet as an electric drum roaster.

Finally I upgraded to bullet recently and not yet started to use.  I found IKAWA home is quite easy to use compare with bullet or you can say it has not that accurate for IKAWA. Usually I roast 200-250g will separate 4-5 times for the roasting. Due to there is no temperature measurement for the ROR you can just adjust the power output and air flow. It leads me to be lazy and use the same profile every time. Therefore it will no incentive for me to study how the air flow and power ror will affect the taste.  I think if your really wanna to step in to home roasting it will be great to have IKAWA pro 100 it will solve all the problems I faced.

hbkdgap,2021-09-04 06:20:35,FrugalHippy,phit7q,Impressed with the Hive Roaster,I’m in the same boat. I’ve used it a few times and trial ran without the data dome.   So far all were wildly different but all tasted great either way. The first try I had my heat cranked high and managed to get a Vienna roast in 3 minutes lol. It was the weirdest thing to taste because it was the dark roast tones but acidic. My guess is the inside of the bean hadn’t developed along with the outside. After asking Mr. Hive he suggested turning the heat to medium did that and again. All my roasts are doing well.   The only thing I’m doing different than you is my batch size. I can’t remember where I read it  it 50g was recommended. I’d imagine that’s why I haven’t had much issues than you. Maybe adjust down to even 100-125g and experiment there.   A good roast needs both even heat transfer but good agitation. An over hauled batch will mess with both.

hbl1h0t,2021-09-04 09:28:10,KCcoffeegeek,phit7q,Impressed with the Hive Roaster,Somewhere he recommended 1 cup as batch size and that is exactly 150g for this bean Ive been using. Ive gotten different results with each batch but I am also taking the roast slightly longer with each batch so I expect it and my results are going the direction I would expect. My really acidic batch #2 I stopped the roast just as 1C was getting going hyperparanoid of rolling into 2C which is pretty easy to do on the Behmor. Batch 4 which was quite a bit more mellow was taken completely through 1C so things are adding up in that regard. My roasts visually look very even so Im not worried about the batch size Im using for this coffee at least.,hbkdgap,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/phit7q/impressed_with_the_hive_roaster/hbl1h0t/'

hbgng6q,2021-09-03 09:13:31,Outrageous_Bother_29,pgza2t,Advice re: export from central america,Can you clarify what you mean by roasters? Is this roasters as in Probat or Diedrich or Roasters as in roasting companies that would want your product? The roasting machine would be a 3-12kg machine that would make roasting and selling locally viable. More locals at origin want good coffee not just crap mixed with corn.  Who is your audience? If you’re looking for specialty coffee roasters they are going to want quality which means low defect high altitude beans with a back story they can sale to their coffee customers. Winning some awards through a cup of excellence helps marketing  to roasters  growing an unusual bean ( Gesha Java Casiopea Sudan Rume) etc. If you diversify your Finca ( give tours bird watchers)  you can attract  coffee roasters.  I am going to generalize but you can also target geographic and cultural roasters . Emerging markets for coffee tend to spend a lot more for quality and uniqueness and won’t care about shipping cost as much.  At the end of the day unless this is a hobby farm you want to feed your family and your workers. Hopefully you can get along with your coffee neighbors and collectively compete for shipping cost and roaster attraction.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pgza2t/advice_re_export_from_central_america/hbgng6q/'

hb3hnf8,2021-08-31 12:44:19,eugow,pf7onw,How to buy larger amounts?,Get in touch with some importers they will be happy to help you and sell you coffee!  What I do is call or email a sales rep at an importer get samples cup and then choose which coffees I want. They will tell you what quantities are available.   Then figure out how much you need say 10 bags of that Guatemalan a month. I ask the importer to set me up on a contract for say 60 bags pulling 10 a month for the next 6 months. This will lock in your current pricing. Usually you can get set up to just pay each month for the amount you release so it’s essentially financed by the importer. They have relationships or own warehouses so the storage costs will get built into your contract with the importer.  Arrange for delivery or pickup as needed and pay as you go.

hb3swbp,2021-08-31 14:00:18,gotagetwithit,pf7onw,How to buy larger amounts?,As  was mentioned with good credit  most importers terms allow you 30 day on the invoice. So if you can turn your inventory before the 30 days the importer is playing the role of short term lender.   You could buy a mixed bag pallet from a forward contract each month especially if your roasting a pallet a month.  So first thing is having a production plan mapped for a few months out at least so you really understand what your needs are.  How many lbs of each coffee you plan to use in blends and straights.  Then have a long talk with your broker and share what your needs are for the short term and longer term. they can help set you up with  a forward contract. the importer will hold the coffee in warehouse until you need it shipped to the roastery.  the balance of undelivered coffees will accumulate a holding fee/warehousing fee as this is coffee you have bought and just awaiting delivery. 6 months out is a good spot for us. this can help you offer the same coffees longer through out the year vs  buying or and inventorying it all at once. That really help if your in a small facility.  If your a larger roaster then you might need to look at a banking relationship with a line of credit or something similar.  Every Coffee roaster has a different supply/finance  situation and need to be looked at and understood from the companys perspective and needs.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pf7onw/how_to_buy_larger_amounts/hb3swbp/'
hb51scw,2021-08-31 19:38:01,TheTapeDeck,pf7onw,How to buy larger amounts?,You buy it all at once until you can get terms (net30 etc)  You can buy it on a card and try to pay it off before the pay period pings or just carry a little balance.  You can also look at Genuine Origin LaBodega Coffee Shrub etc. They sell in smaller (50-65lb) boxes that can ship UPS and they sell in palletized quantities as well.  Your coffee options open up dramatically when you can order by the pallet.

haxsp6s,2021-08-30 08:24:09,poopwasfood,pebteg,What are high quality coffee beans?,There are many ways to elevate your coffee consumption: the cheapest is a cheap grinder and an aero-press  The medium expensive is a decent burr grinder (hand or electric) and a pour over (v60-melitta) coffee brewer. The best way is to get a really nice ($100-500) grinder and use any method really.   The number one important piece of coffee gear is a grinder. My personal recommendation is the “Baratza Encore”. It might actually still be on sale on the Baratza website.   As far as coffee if it has a -roasted on- date the is less than two weeks old and it is a -single origin- it is probably pretty good.   Check out Drifraway coffee subscription service to get a variety pack of “good” coffee and learn what your taste is in specialty coffee.   I happen to also be a coffee roaster if you are really lost I could send you some. Message me directly if you like   Good luck and welcome to the world of specialty coffee,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pebteg/what_are_high_quality_coffee_beans/haxsp6s/'
hawcgq0,2021-08-29 23:03:13,AnimorphsGeek,pebteg,What are high quality coffee beans?,Coffee is literally the most complicated food on the planet. I think at last count there were about 900 potential volatile compounds in roasted coffee that contribute to aroma and flavor. It can taste like anything from dark chocolate and oak to blueberry wine. So good coffee is whatever you like. That being said specialty coffee is coffee that is grown harvested processed roasted and brewed by people who care about bringing out the fullest potential. Not only in flavor but also in its environmental and socioeconomic effects. That being said if you like darkly roasted or artificially flavored coffee brewed in a container thats terrible for the environment then enjoy.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pebteg/what_are_high_quality_coffee_beans/hawcgq0/'
haxu3oc,2021-08-30 08:34:06,montaneroscoffee,pebteg,What are high quality coffee beans?,It depends on what you define as good I think it largely comes down to what flavours of coffee you enjoy drinking. For example do you have a preference for fruity undertones sweet undertones dark chocolate notes etc.?   To answer your question about determining which beans are high quality I would suggest checking for the following indicators:  1) Does the package contain clear flavour descriptors?  2) Is the coffee a medium roast? (dark roast is usually an indicator of lower grade coffee)  3) Does the package contains information about the coffees origin? (look for detailed info on origin of coffee beans)  4) Does the company provide info on harvest dates? (beans harvested within 6 weeks would be considered fresh healthy and the highest quality)  Hope this helps :),-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pebteg/what_are_high_quality_coffee_beans/haxu3oc/'
hay700t,2021-08-30 10:02:51,Madmohawkfilms,pebteg,What are high quality coffee beans?,Drink what YOU LIKE. Like with Alcohol when drinking neat the quality comes thru. Making a cocktail it’s much harder to tell you aren’t drinking your favorite libation. Drink the coffee black n you’ll notice differences a lot easier than if your adding cream and sugar and other flavorings like vanilla or pumpkin spice etc.   Majority of time I drink brands like Chock Full of Nuts Maxwell House Folgers and add liberal amount of cream and sugar.  Even when in mood for something “better” most cafes by me in South Brooklyn are using Lavazza. Occasionally I’ll visit Java Joe’s or Porto Rico for a treat.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pebteg/what_are_high_quality_coffee_beans/hay700t/'
hazi7eq,2021-08-30 15:33:29,Phlier,pebteg,What are high quality coffee beans?,In addition to the great advice already given in this thread...  1. Explore your local coffee shops. Drink a cup of coffee from as many shops as you can.   2. For making and drinking coffee at home: Do a bit of reading on the internet. Even an hour of research will go a long way. Learn the basics about grinding extraction temps extraction methods. Then move on to what different roast levels will do learn about the flavors produced from the various coffee producing regions.  3. Surprisingly it doesnt take a fortune to enjoy coffee at home. A simple Aeropress or Vario and a good hand grinder will produce astonishingly good coffee as long as youve read up on the basics of how to use them. Spending an hour on the internet reading about how to use the Aeropress and/or Vario will go a long way as will the time spent learning about grinding.  4. Learn about how roasted coffee ages and proper storage methods.  5. Enjoy the process! If youre not having fun along the way youre doing it wrong.  ) View failures as learning experiences. Try to put a label on the flavors you dont enjoy and view it as knowledge gained.  6. Dont get too overwhelmed by the ocean of knowledge out there! Yes you can get your brain melted by diving too deep so come up for air. You dont need a PhD in coffee to make and enjoy fantastic coffee so only go into the water as deep as is fun for you.   7. There is nothing wrong with the coffee that YOU like. Even if its a cup of Folgers instant if you like it then thats all that matters.  Yes I did completely avoid answering the questions you asked as what I consider to be good tasting coffee beans you might completely hate. But hopefully there might be a tidbit or two in there that helps you to find those great brands and beans that are just right for YOU.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pebteg/what_are_high_quality_coffee_beans/hazi7eq/'
hb0wyfx,2021-08-30 22:45:03,Violet624,pebteg,What are high quality coffee beans?,Im just going to add a couple of tips: Everyone is talking about grinders and such because coffee freshly ground is the best quality. If you can get an electric grinder definitely consider going that route. And dont store your beans in the freezer! That makes them go stale.   I also find I like different roasts with different ways of making coffee. A French or Italian dark roast -espresso or French press. A medium or light bodied roast I have the little pour over cone to make a cup at a time.   I think your friend is being a snob. I used to work for a coffee roasting company and you know its great if you want to explore coffee! But do it only if you want to. I still enjoy cheap hazelnut flavored gas station coffee.

hawrz54,2021-08-30 02:40:34,vgbn,pebteg,What are high quality coffee beans?,High quality beans come from well-maintained farms. Picked in their ripe (red cherry) state processed in-situ with enough care that the beans dont get bad in the process.   Good quality beans usually have relatively uniform size and shape well-developed during roasting not too dark but light enough to have a good well-balanced cup when brewed.   Good beans will have consistent flavor from the pouch to ground and during and post brew. It should come as beans not as ground. Grind as much as you need in a cup (10-20gr) drink within 10-15 min.   Recipe wise I find the best balance between body and sweetness is achieved by 1:10-15 ground to water ratio (10-15ml per 1gr of ground coffee 96-98°C).   Thats also personal. What works for me might not work for you.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pebteg/what_are_high_quality_coffee_beans/hawrz54/'

hayu1zj,2021-08-30 12:42:09,TheTapeDeck,pebteg,What are high quality coffee beans?,Opinion: you won’t know it when you taste it at first. Think of it as magic eye. Those still look like technicolor vomit to me… never seen the schooner.  What in my experience happens first is that you begin to notice “that’s a good cup of coffee” flavors without having the burnt rubber + ashtray nonsense. And then you start to crave that specifically preferring to avoid the burning UNLESS you are permanently trapped in the cycle of “burnt equals strong equals I am very badass.” Which happens.  It takes a pretty long time to really get deep into flavor subtlety in coffee. And unless you’re going to work in coffee there’s no reason to be in a hurry to understand the differences between Sumatra Colombia and Kenya at similar roast levels. You would simply eventually get there without trying.  Initially the only reason (apart from F those horrible landfill kcups) to do this is curiosity and the ability to share a nicer coffee experience with someone who is perhaps deeper into that process than you are. I suppose there are also sustainability and non-exploitation societal reasons but that’s really not as easy to sort out at the consumer end than we would like to pretend it is.  To someone who really enjoys good coffee your kcup is like a military meals ready to eat survival substance. We would drink it and thank you if the alternative is no coffee. But there’s no “hell yes” moment in that cup ever. And that’s sort of the only reason I drink coffee. I sort of think that without that complex beauty I’d just walk on caffeine forever.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/pebteg/what_are_high_quality_coffee_beans/hayu1zj/'

h9fxppz,2021-08-18 12:17:04,thegrandlyon,p6wqxn,Anyone out there printing your own labels? What do you use or recommend or wish you had known?,Yup. Got lots of input on this. I dont recommend doing full color printing yourself. Its hard to make it look good and the printers that do it are an expensive pain to maintain. We do this for some white labeling but are discontinuing it because it looks bad and is a waste of time during production.  Look into thermal transfer printing. We use a Zebra ZT220 to print black text on pre-printed rolls of labels. We like lots of roasters do some combination of having stuff designed and printed professionally and adding information ourselves that changes frequently like origins tasting notes and roast date etc.  Heres our situation: a number of differently colored pre-printed labels that have spots to put origin info roast date notes etc but none of the actual info. Then using the ZT220 we print that info in black on the colorful label maybe a few weeks worth at a time (thermal transfer printing is really really fast). Looks great on our bags and the cost is like 4 cents per label.   Hope that helps!

h9juu5p,2021-08-19 09:38:26,lingo_linguistics,p6wqxn,Anyone out there printing your own labels? What do you use or recommend or wish you had known?,I don’t recommend printing your own labels unless your labels change frequently or unless you do private labeling for other people.   I use a TM-C7500 paired with Bartender and it’s a headache. It gets the job done but sometimes I want to take the printer out back with a baseball bat. It’s very finicky lots of maintenance and the labels don’t ever turn out like they would if they were professionally done.   If you want to print your own I recommend buying colored/textured labels and not just purchasing matte white with intent of flood coating them because it will not look professional and getting the color to fill border-border is quite difficult.   Just know when you get into printing you are now acting as a small scale printer and will need the knowledge that comes with it to have good looking labels. You may be more skilled than I am in that area so YMMV.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/p6wqxn/anyone_out_there_printing_your_own_labels_what_do/h9juu5p/'

h9a58wd,2021-08-17 05:24:14,gotagetwithit,p5x6pl,Smoothly declining ROR?,yes we do.    But when I started roasting on a Probat L12 in the 90s the gas settings were run at  90% start of roast 20% for a 45 sec-minute mid roast just before first crack and 60% finish until second crack.  unfortunately that  process was creating a lot of roast defects.   Now I use a gradual reduction of the gas over the whole roast and have so much more control of each phase of the roasting process.   So for charge temp your gas level looks good  just try to get the turnaround about 1:30   and as you proceed through he roast make  gas adjustments lower as you are roasting and proceeding into first crack. Not really any hard rules just keep experimenting with your machine and you will get what you are after.  LPT: the recipe for the roast isnt the ROR curve its the time spent in each stage of the roast.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/p5x6pl/smoothly_declining_ror/h9a58wd/'

Or if you just know of any I could check out.,I prefer single origins because when roasted well they can have lots of nuance and character in their flavor profile. Blends can be great too but there’s something fascinating about hunting down coffees from a single farm a single lot or comprised of a single cultivar. Even more so when you get into other variables like elevation drying beds washed or naturals 24 hour anaerobic fermentation etc. (Black & White roasters are great for trying out these different processes)   Are you mostly looking for roasters in the US? In a particular state? Drip or Espresso?  A few of my go-to’s in the US are Onyx(AR) GGET(CA) Sey(NY) Black&White(NC) and Share(MA). There are so many to choose from nowadays I use the coffee industry site Sprudge to check out other roasters I haven’t discovered.  When I can spend a little more on international roasters I like to get from Gardelli Coffee Collective Jiribilla Momos and April.

They’ve been around for a while but had only been selling beans at the farmer market and drip to-go at a local salon. But they recently acquired a counter in a local whiskey lounge.  By trade I’m a graphic designer and they’ve hired me to make them a new website and a friend of mine will be managing their social media. For research I wanted to look at other single origin roasters and figured a sub of coffee lovers would be the best place to start. Googling “top single origin roasters” doesn’t exactly reap me the benefits that I’m looking for. Especially when you consider articles like that usually have some sort of sponsorship biased. I’ve always liked that I usually get fairly passionate opinions and insight when I I turn to Reddit. I’ve also always loved coffee and I’m totally over the moon to take on such a neat work opportunity that allows me to spend time learning about a topic I’m fascinated about.,h98plrq,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/p5t40r/im_super_interested_if_their_are_people_who/h9cs2j2/'

h92doqh,2021-08-15 12:21:20,Dettak,p4xvyj,Helps with very hard beans,Uff man Im surprised that you find any flavors at all in such a long roast. I actually havent heard about this long roast at all yet. Anyway increase your drop temperature and/or drastically increase heat power to get to at least first crack under 10 minutes to get something from the beans. High density beans can take a lot of heat without getting burnt. Chances are your beans clogged the mill because you baked them by this super slow roast thus they essentially remain green and so superhard probably on the inside. You need to apply much more heat to roast them and not just bake them.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/p4xvyj/helps_with_very_hard_beans/h92doqh/'

I’m usually pretty flat on the temp rise when I’m sliding into FC so it doesn’t get too much hotter than when FC happens when I “drop.” I try to give it about 30s after FC wraps up but if the temp wants to rise or the ROR curve spikes before then I kill the heat then.

h95c412,2021-08-16 05:16:22,Dettak,p4xvyj,Helps with very hard beans,Try around 200 degrees Celsius on the air temperature and try to put in more heat even during roasting if possible.

hcvr71a,2021-09-14 16:01:21,moustachecoffee,p4xvyj,Helps with very hard beans,it sounds like you need more heat. I would say as well that your air measurement probably doesnt correspond to the bean temp measurement that you normally hear referenced by people. That said even bean temps among different professional roasters can be significantly off - meaning numbers are really only relevant to specific roasters calibrated the same way.  &#x200B  TLDR dont worry about temps for the time being and put a lot more heat in to get to first crack around 9 minutes in.,h92rdhs,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/p4xvyj/helps_with_very_hard_beans/hcvr71a/'

h7jh03m,2021-08-03 04:22:08,TheTapeDeck,ox0kvc,what are you roasters doing to manage price risk COGS?,We don’t buy anything below a price threshold and we have no top price. We keep pretty close to a sliding margin so that were generally making similar margin on $3 green as $7 green. As prices fluctuate a returning coffee that might have sold for $16.50 might now sell for $18. I don’t think we run into any trouble until a bag is averaging over $23 or so. And if the whole market were to go there I don’t think wed struggle because of that.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ox0kvc/what_are_you_roasters_doing_to_manage_price_risk/h7jh03m/'
h7jup1v,2021-08-03 06:36:29,gotagetwithit,ox0kvc,what are you roasters doing to manage price risk COGS?,One thing to consider are you buying containers or buying Spot coffees. Large Roasters /Importers buying containers will hedge there inventory against any price movements  to set an average price and protect against any sudden swings up or down in the long term price. Thats another world  and involves Lots of Capital a finance team and comfort with margin calls.  So small roasters Just buying Spot or using Forward Contract with the magic of Dollar Cost Avg  you will be existentially neutral the market over time.  We have moved a majority of our coffees to a direct relationship where we pay the farms directly between $4-$8 USD.  if Prices sustain until next year we will adjust accordingly . We still have a few origins we still buy on the Spot market from Specialty brokers and those coffees will just have to cost a little more.    Yea your invoices increase but as u/TheTapeDeck mentioned having a sliding margin works very well and allows you to adjust prices as needed. Some time the price moves really quick and a few months later is back to a normalized price so just sitting tight and not making any quick moves works as well.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ox0kvc/what_are_you_roasters_doing_to_manage_price_risk/h7jup1v/'

hcte2m6,2021-09-14 06:14:53,xkinggk,ox0kvc,what are you roasters doing to manage price risk COGS?,We like price increases. When the price of Specialty organic coffee was at $3+ things were great. We could pay our farmers way more and since we had fixed pricing with them we didnt have to worry about COGS too much.   In 2020 we were busier than ever. Everyone was panic buying and our sales were as if we were having a discount promo that we do in the summer.   If things slow down a lot we would just slow down production and mitigate our internal COGS. We have other income streams besides coffee that would hold us down. Honestly we play things like this by ear and figure it out as we go along. Weve never been through a pandemic so there wasnt a book that said what to do. We are fortunate to be a very flexible company and can accommodate changes in a moments notice.,hctd08t,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ox0kvc/what_are_you_roasters_doing_to_manage_price_risk/hcte2m6/'

h73ofkm,2021-07-30 09:49:17,theknockbox,ounod9,Poll on best beans in the world,We should probably talk about how cringe this poll is. Please regard the following three points:  1. Youve reduced the entire continent of Africa to a single item 2. Youve missed some of the most renowned coffee growing regions in Central America 3. Youve included two of the worst coffee growing regions in the quiz  First and foremost I dont know if youre reduction of Africa to a single region is coming from extreme ignorance of coffee or if youre subconscious racism just makes you group the entire continent together. Either way its frankly insulting and I would encourage you not to do it again. The difference between Burundi Kenyan and Ethiopian coffee is as pronounced if not more so than the differences between central American coffees. Im not trying to be all woke on you but this is pretty ignorant.   Secondly and most disturbing to me youve missed some of the best central American sub-regions...namely El Salvador and Costa Rica. Ever heard of [Aida Battle](https://blog.bluebottlecoffee.com/posts/aida-batlle-in-conversation)? Figured not. She has been producing some of the worlds best coffee for over a decade out of El Salvador. This stuff is no joke amazing according to people all over the world. Its great stuff. Not to mention that Costa Rica has long been known for its beautiful delicate coffee with wonderful acidity. Now Im not knocking Guatemala or Columbia both are fantastic producing regions. But its not like theyre the only ones in the continent.   Lastly you have broken out Jamaica and Hawaii - Im trying to think of a WBC champion who used beans from either of those two regions. In fact the only specialty coffee shop Ive ever heard of using these beans are coffee shops in Hawaii and Jamaica! And its not like this stuff is hard to get. Now Im not knocking Hawaii I was born and raised there but the coffee isnt exactly well regarded in high-end coffee circles. Im surprised you didnt put Kopi Luwak on here based on your inclusion of Jamaica and Hawaii.   Now usually I like to be a bit more friendly about liking whatever coffee you like.

h72qvi9,2021-07-30 05:35:54,BhodiSatoshi,oudwuj,Anyone putting their coffee in a third-party delivery system? (Steeped Instant or Cometeer),My issue with Steeped is actual market size. I think it works with bigger brands but not for smaller roasters.  We brought in a small roaster who had collabed with Steeped and ended up basically giving the coffee away after 4-5 months.   Just my small experience with it. The taste was there though for what it is.

h7dupvs,2021-08-01 19:29:11,,oudwuj,Anyone putting their coffee in a third-party delivery system? (Steeped Instant or Cometeer),I work for a medium sized roaster and we sell whole bean ground k-cups instant coldbrew and even an alcoholic version of coffee.   To be honest I don’t get the whole steeped coffee concept. I tried it and it wasn’t for me. It was actually worse then pre-ground coffee in my opinion.   We sell an instant version of our coffee but it’s a slow seller. Initial sales were brisk but once the novelty wore off it’s been a snail’s pace. I think fans of our brand bought a first bottle and just didn’t bother to get a second. Additionally a bottle goes a long way and it’s typically not something consumed on a daily basis. Real coffee aficionados don’t indulge much with instant of any method.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/oudwuj/anyone_putting_their_coffee_in_a_thirdparty/h7dupvs/'
hfqcsbu,2021-10-07 07:24:26,TSWood,oudwuj,Anyone putting their coffee in a third-party delivery system? (Steeped Instant or Cometeer),I work with a roaster involved with Snapchill and Cometeer. Snapchill weve had some consistency issues with taste and extraction in the beginning but things have definitely gotten better. They had some canning issues too that lead to a few lost batches (cans were swelling and bulging) but they were good about working with us to fix the issues. Flavors are good they did a great job brewing our coffees to our specifications and they sell well as a grab and go item.   Cometeer Im still not sold on. I have tried several capsules theyve brewed of our coffees and other roasters coffees and they always taste weird. Like theres this unpleasant thickness and metallic flavor that never goes away and always reminds me of coffee thats sat in an airpot for like 5 hours and gotten stale. Dark roasts are usually a bit better because light roasts have almost always been very flat and bland. I reached out to Cometeer about this and they told me that the way they brew and freeze the concentrates does result in some loss in flavor predominantly in regards to the more delicate florals and aromatics. Which frankly seems to defeat the purpose of the product for me. If the idea is that the capsules provide a drinker with a low effort low cost of entry cup of third-wave coffee it better taste better than something spit out of a keurig. They did say their improving their brew methods but we shall see.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/oudwuj/anyone_putting_their_coffee_in_a_thirdparty/hfqcsbu/'

It’s a pleasant but syrupy experience. The earthiness is missing I like to do cloth filter for some coffees Cometeer has moved in the opposite direction of cloth. I really wanted to believe in this.

h6wst2d,2021-07-28 19:43:20,HIVEROASTER,otn3kb,After many tries I finally got a blonde roast!,I find the key to light roasts is massive early power and very short roast duration.  I run them at about 6 to 6:30 then dump the roast about halfway through the pop assuming that the other 30 seconds needed will happen in the cooler. Takes some pretty massive BTUs to make it happen but the brightness and lovely acidity is amazing.  Many blonde roasts are so sour as they are underdeveloped.

Once beans start getting taken out of the jar the ratio of beans/air becomes increasingly worse.  That is why the Airscape type of container is recommended to keep the ratio constant and help with freshness / slow the degradation of the coffee beans due to exposure to... air.  Another danger is that there are documented cases of sealed glass containers exploding due to pressure buildup of beans off-gassing.

h6dk6pa,2021-07-24 08:55:29,TheTapeDeck,oqrvjs,How do I handle non experienced business owners?,I think you need to know that the national average for coffee roasters is around $15/hour as bad as that may be.   4 years of roasting if youve got a good paying roasting gig you might just want to stick with that... 4 years isn’t going to command an increase over regional averages unless youre winning major awards and they can market that. I am sure a lot of these hopeful new people are due for a reality check (I.e. no one is going to buy your coffee online instead of Onyx etc) but also this is the grindiest industry I’ve ever worked in.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/oqrvjs/how_do_i_handle_non_experienced_business_owners/h6dk6pa/'

h60tl2s,2021-07-21 09:54:32,theknockbox,oosk9x,How long are coffee beans good?,First Im assuming were talking roasted coffee here and not green. My impression is that this is largely due to the release of CO2 from the coffee post-roast. There are some good papers online that you can look up but [heres one](https://towardsdatascience.com/coffee-bean-degassing-d747c8a9d4c9) that has some comprehensive graphs that will give you a reasonable answer to your question.   The TLDR is that different types of beans different roast profiles and different storage conditions will impact the rate at which coffee degasses. But most coffee thats been roasted ages parabollically. This means that the degradation of quality is fast at the beginning then slows down over time. Check the graphs for more details.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/oosk9x/how_long_are_coffee_beans_good/h60tl2s/'

h60uxas,2021-07-21 10:03:49,Mutiu2,oosk9x,How long are coffee beans good?,There are no fixed numbers. Basically the beans slow go rancid. How slow depends on the beans used how much they were roasted amount of sir and light and heat exposure. None of those things are standard.   Use your nose to judge.  If you don’t do anything silly you should have no problem getting a couple of very good weeks easily. I’ve managed to get 6 decent weeks out of some roasted dark and stored in a cool place in vacuum bag.   They should be usable sellable at six weeks but then your brand reputation is going to match the quality you’re selling which is less than the taste at 1-2 weeks old.  If I were you I’d hire a food scientist give them a spec that you want to sell beans up to 6 weeks old - and let them back out a roast profile a d storage specs for you.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/oosk9x/how_long_are_coffee_beans_good/h60uxas/'

h62tf3p,2021-07-21 18:51:42,uuutangnamegenerator,oosk9x,How long are coffee beans good?,I am speaking as a consumer here I dont roast. My experience is with light and very light roasts you have about 4 weeks before you drop to an 8/10 or lower. After that? I dont really stick around to find out much Im usually done with the bag or have frozen the beans. Into the 5th and 6th week I think youre probably starting into the stale flavors rather than just losing flavor.  All of this happens a bit faster with darker roasts and the darker the roast the more rapid the off gassing and oxidation.   Personally I refuse purchase a bag of coffee that is 4 weeks old. Its not worth the short span that Ive got to drink it and why put myself in the position where it MIGHT still be great but its definitely past its prime. At a discount? Nah its not for me - buying coffee usually isnt a financially motivated decision and if I can get fresh beans that I like that are roasted recently - thats going to be my go to - every single time.  When you say airtight do you mean airtight or does it have a one way valve for off-gassing?  I think the fall off isnt super severe after the 3 week mark but my tolerance for a 70% quality is very low. I dont want to buy a sub par product. I support roasters who are good but more than good I specifically support roasters that put out a consistently good product.   This may all change based on who your customers are and if they give a shit about good coffee or not what financial position their in and dozens of other things. People who arent into coffee either may not care.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/oosk9x/how_long_are_coffee_beans_good/h62tf3p/'

I guess my question was more like with an average premium coffee after 4-5 weeks as you say does it go from 90%+ to 20% or does it just lose some of its quality in your opinion? But maybe thats a subjective thing that cant really be answered.,h60n1vy,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/oosk9x/how_long_are_coffee_beans_good/h61cat2/'
h61cexh,2021-07-21 12:04:57,EchoDelta365,oosk9x,How long are coffee beans good?,Okay yes I see what you mean.

h61fgau,2021-07-21 12:26:32,SyntheticCephalopod,oosk9x,How long are coffee beans good?,The quality degrades over time as oxidation occurs. So as others have pointed out its highly subjective and varies per person.  I can only speak for myself but in my opinion 6-8 week old beans that havent been stored in an air-tight container would taste stale.  That said the beans dont go bad and are still safe to drink if that was a concern.  EDIT (caveat to above): beans \_can\_ go bad if they were stored improperly for a period of time in a humid or moist environment and mold begins to grow.,h61cexh,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/oosk9x/how_long_are_coffee_beans_good/h61fgau/'

There are some quaker beans in that photo as well meaning the cherries were picked over or under prime ripeness.  The quality is likely there but just part of sourcing in Yemen. The real test: how does it taste!  Edit: spelling is hard.,h5b5znp,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/okzan2/specialty_coffee_quality/h5banba/'
h5bae11,2021-07-15 12:48:57,et-regina,okzan2,specialty coffee quality,The lighter coloured beans are likely quakers - basically beans from cherries that were picked underripe.

h53v283,2021-07-13 18:46:39,Hooblah2u2,ojslr2,On Marketing Budgets,Theres no hard or fast rule about the percent you should spend on marketing. You just want your investment to be outpaced by your return :) Sounds like youve done pretty well without investing much which is a great sign.   **The most important question is this: What kind of marketing are you looking for?**   Getting customers in seats at the cafe? Ecommerce or subscriptions? Marketing to get wholesale customers? The approach/investment will look pretty different for each sales channel so its hard to get more specific without extra details on your particular goals.  I operate a small micro-agency that specializes in the coffee industry but we only do a small sliver of marketing services because in my opinion 99% of coffee businesses do not need most services an agency will try to sell you. Esp in coffee where most of us do not come from business or marketing backgrounds I see a lot of people lose money to half-assed agency contracts. What kinds of things are you being pitched? Happy to add my 2c from the marketing perspective.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ojslr2/on_marketing_budgets/h53v283/'
h5421ez,2021-07-13 19:50:23,BhodiSatoshi,ojslr2,On Marketing Budgets,I think yeah the hardest part is redefining our goals after covid. Basically it was survival mode for 1.5 years and I feel stuck in that mentality. So just get getting back to a solid long term plan. Need fresh ideas to make it happen.  And I’m ultra skeptical of being sold on bloated services. Full confession I have a degree in marketing and design but it’s just a situation where I don’t feel I have the skill sets to take it to next level. And I don’t mind getting that off my plate either. Would rather focus on team coaching and product development.   Basically: would love to see a younger demo late high school kids who will be regulars throughout college and university. Would love to add e-commerce as it’s non-existing and eventually wholesale clients.   Frankly I’m the guy who made the mistake of trying to do everything and realizing now that to elevate I need to delegate and outsource.    Thanks!,h53v283,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ojslr2/on_marketing_budgets/h5421ez/'
h54cze1,2021-07-13 21:42:52,Hooblah2u2,ojslr2,On Marketing Budgets,Survival mode is what I heard from everyone in my network. Glad to hear it sounds like youre getting back to something more like solid footing.  Reaching high school students is an interesting challenge I havent heard many go after. I honestly didnt know many folks in high school who liked coffee most of us got into coffee during college. The shop I managed a few years ago did college hours where college students got a discount during slower times (with ID of course). Many of them came back during non college hours. We also did things like coupon drop offs at dorms for a free cup of coffee to build that initial momentum.  In terms of ecommerce theres really two ways to go: (1) creating an online storefront to grow revenue from your existing customers and brand reach or (2) creating a more online-dedicated brand that can compete and draw in customers around the country.   Option #1 is typically the best starting point because it gives you new sales channels and a smaller loyal market to build systems and experience with. Launching ecommerce gets you involved with a bunch of stuff like shipping packaging etc so making a store for your cafe (rather than a nationally-competing ecommerce store) can help you get started without tons of pressure -- and it can still be a good growth channel since it opens up new ways for customers to engage with you.  Going #2 is hard because there are a bazillion ecommerce coffee companies and will be a significant investment thatll be pretty hands-on and will require some sort of team (likely made up of existing staff you and 1-2 agencies). The upside is that you can generate customers from virtually anywhere you can ship -- theyre just hard to earn the attention of.  In my mind local marketing is best done in-house. Ecommerce is best given to more dedicated specialists. Paid social is somewhere in-between since it doesnt \*have\* to be complicated but it often is expensive to outsource.,h5421ez,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ojslr2/on_marketing_budgets/h54cze1/'

h53aao7,2021-07-13 15:45:35,Lolzlolrofl,ojq70s,World Coffee Roasting curves,I would be interested in hearing what some other roasters have to say but here is my take.  Some types of green beans have a tendency to crash flick or crash and flick after first crack and it can be challenging to dial in your profile to compensate for these things without having a few roasts of the same coffee in a row. Im not 100% how roasting competitions are structured but it might be difficult to get a feel for a certain bean without being able to do a few roasts.  Also while the flick in this instance appears to be quite dramatic if you look at the bean curve its pretty good until the ending where it flattens out for just a little while. It can look deceiving as the left graph is 70 to 245 degrees while the right graph is only 0 to 17 degrees. So while the RoR dip may look quite dramatic it only has a small effect on the actual bean curve here.  In my opinion its still possible to get a good result if your rate of rise has crashed and kicked a little bit. The main thing you want to watch for is development time and degrees Celsius increase after first crack.  While it is better to avoid the crash and flick of your rate of rise some beans are just more inclined to do this and can be compensated for once you get to know them.  Hope this helps!,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ojq70s/world_coffee_roasting_curves/h53aao7/'
h55fj3t,2021-07-14 06:12:02,Knorrena,ojq70s,World Coffee Roasting curves,I would exercise some caution with raos book. He presents his own practice and guidelines. Its not a law or a rule thats just how he roasts coffee thats his style. You may chose to or not to adopt this style dont gospelize it though.  If you do chose to follow that style know that its not always possible to achieve it. Environmental conditions like temperature and relative humidity bean condition meadurement errors all play a role in your ability to match rao style.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ojq70s/world_coffee_roasting_curves/h55fj3t/'
h557t0j,2021-07-14 04:53:15,gotagetwithit,ojq70s,World Coffee Roasting curves,My personal experience is you cant taste the coffee from just looking at the profile data. Only after cupping the coffee blind and reference the profile can you make any decisions regarding the changes in time or temp needed to bring a particular coffee to perfection. I believe you can follow the correct profile and still have a disappointing cup especially if youre green quality is not on the mark. Taste is king,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ojq70s/world_coffee_roasting_curves/h557t0j/'
h6ckn4n,2021-07-24 02:22:00,BerryBirdCoffee,ojq70s,World Coffee Roasting curves,I think from my experience roasting it really depends on the bean also where and how your temperature is detected. Sorry if this just start to cause you more confusion so Im gonna list a few things that are derived from my experience either its from taking the SCA Roasting course or sample roasting:  1. Steep drops in RoR during the Maillard temperature zone that increases the time spent in this zone greatly enhances some of my island-grown coffee like Kona that is known for cocoa. So the crash didnt really matter here still tasted quite good 2. Raising the RoR when my roast is 10-15 degrees (celsius) can help it taste quite clean and avoid some of the muted flavors that might happen with the slow roasts. Again fast ascension didnt make it worse  Then again Scott Rao speaks from his own experience of which may involve the different type of machine he uses or the people who drinks his coffee just simply likes this style more. It may be safe to use his methods first as he has decades of roasting experience. But if you would allow me to give you just one suggestion: figure out a curve that really works for a bean that you commonly use and then continuously tweak it so its different each roast and then taste each batch. That way you can really understand which tweak can cause the actual flavor change. Of which I would recommend only changing 1 variable for each new roast (RoR airflow drum rotation speed etc.),-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ojq70s/world_coffee_roasting_curves/h6ckn4n/'

Dirty  mouldy sour phenolic taste  Other issue: Ochratoxin Risk.  Cause: argricultural. Blackening results from over fermentation.  Remedies: pick only ripe fruit avoid over fermentation during processing.  Screening/density sorting/ hand sorting or color sorting during processing also helps  Edit: having 1 of these already disqualifies it as specialty coffee.

h4dmei6,2021-07-07 10:49:08,jutley1991,oe9db4,Roaster seeking business advice,Okay so it’s not coffee but my girlfriend started a candle business June of 2020 she got furloughed and got to work on not being reliant on a 9-5. These are just my observations on how she has exponentially grown her business over the last year and reached more customers many of them on the other side of the country. So I hope that this will be helpful to you.   Instagram is mandatory in today’s age social media is one of the best marketing tools out there. She’s got a personal a business and another that is essentially a networking page for local businesses. More on this later.   Etsy or another small business platform emphasizing on handmade products is also going to be essential. Etsy was her first store front and continues to be an integral part in getting her product out there. She’s only run ads a couple of times and it does not seem necessary if you provide a great product with even greater customer service as the 5 star reviews will speak louder than any ad.   Exposure through local shops this was something I initially pushed because she really did not want a brick and mortar. After all why get away from a 9-5 in retail if you’re just gonna open a shop? This will probably be different everywhere but in our small town our local shops absolutely loved and encouraged getting her product on the shelf. She sells them at whole sale and the store sells them at her MSRP. So she does not make too much profit but it’s a great way to bring in a couple thousand a month to dump directly back into the business.   Popup shops open markets farmers markets etc…  The one thing she really had no interest in doing was a store front however at some point a local reached out to us asking her to be apart of a small popup they were going to do to help handmade artisans in our little town make some extra sales and so we went. One led to another and then another and pretty soon we were doing them monthly and then every other week and at this point after this weekend we are booked every weekend through the beginning of September. Because these small events bring in customers and money.   Back to that networking IG basically she’s used to bring businesses together for promotion collab and to post events. It’s followed by businesses and just local people so they can see every little even every single weekend. Then the other small businesses that are attending these events share to their online following. Everyone shares with everyone and it reaches thousands of people. Needless to say she isn’t the only one who has put together a page like this and there is a very good chance wherever you are there is something similar. Become a part of that. Everyday people supporting each other.   Lastly and definitely not for everyone but she started a YouTube channel focusing on vlogging about small business and offering small business tips but also showcasing her product. She was monetized in about 6months and although still a very small channel. It’s constantly growing we just submitted her first sponsored video for review by a company that reached out to us.   I know it’s not coffee but I’m hoping that some of these strategies that we’ve used that are putting us on track to maybe help me get away from my soul grinding 9-5. As she is growing to the point where she needs more and more of my help could help you in your venture.

h2o6yjx,2021-06-22 10:13:50,butumm,o5r4tl,Why are quakers called quakers?,So I have a theory.    Quakers (the religious group) are pacifists. Its against their religion to fight in a war which is one of the reasons they were leaving Europe and settling in North America in the 17th and 18th centuries. The United States codified freedom of religion into the Constitution which meant the freedom to refuse to participate in military duty due to your religion. So quakers (the beans) are called such because they refuse to participate in the roast.   I could be way off base here but its always made sense to me.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/o5r4tl/why_are_quakers_called_quakers/h2o6yjx/'
h2obgwt,2021-06-22 10:47:21,jaime-lobo,o5r4tl,Why are quakers called quakers?,It seems like people are waaay overcomplicating this.  Yes the Quakers are a religious group that left Europe for the America/new world but the key is that many left the U.S. in the 20th century.  A large group moved to Costa Rica in the late 40s/early 50s (as they were increasingly uncomfortable with the warmongering of the U.S.). They settled primarily in Montverde area among many of the coffee fincas.  I have always heard the term for the lighter beans was a reference by the locals to the lighter skin color of Quaker transplants.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/o5r4tl/why_are_quakers_called_quakers/h2obgwt/'

However after roasting they’ll be a lighter brown than the rest of the batch. This is because there won’t be as many sugars which are necessary for the Maillard reaction (scroll back up to recap this). Quakers have a dry or papery flavour.

For Ethiopian Yirgacheffees I would say that after 6-8 months after harvest freshness start to decline increasingly even in grainpro bags.

It’s really best and easiest to talk to your supplier.,h2djr16,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/o3fk9x/green_coffee_freshness/h2djxpr/'
h2dkc8w,2021-06-19 17:03:37,AgentSam2,o3fk9x,Green Coffee Freshness,Thats a fair point... No harm in asking the new place but I feel like if they are willing to sell stale beans they would also be willing to lie about it!,h2djxpr,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/o3fk9x/green_coffee_freshness/h2dkc8w/'
h2dkltq,2021-06-19 17:06:08,Pieinthesky42,o3fk9x,Green Coffee Freshness,Well if you want to sit around and conjecture and have us brainstorm possibilities that’s def something that redditors do however if you’re trying to solve this the easiest thing is to just ask them. They may or may not lie I have no idea where you are getting your beans from how they store their beans etc... that’s why actual information over conjecture is more valuable.

h2dokdx,2021-06-19 17:44:32,Pieinthesky42,o3fk9x,Green Coffee Freshness,I’m not trying to be insulting but for information on your beans the best source is from where you bought them as I said if you want to spitball with people that’s fine but actually solving your mystery could be just asking your supplier.

h2ltj5i,2021-06-21 18:49:53,UhOhByeByeBadBoy,o0mv8z,Colombian huila supremo I roasted last night… thoughts ?,It’s a finicky little machine. I have the 540. It’s annoying because you have to balance agitating the beans with over heating the beans.  You can get satisfying coffee with them but I never mastered mine. In general aim for you beans to go from green to yellow in the first 4:30-5:30 minutes ( in theory) and then aim for another 3:30-5:00 after that for first crack.  Once first crack starts you generally want to develop the bean for 1:30-2:30. The end color of your bean determines a lot of the flavor the other element is how fast the roast is going to get to that end temperature.   There is WAY too much theory and knowledge out there and I am just barely getting started so I can’t offer too much insight but hopefully those phases give you some goal posts.,h2lscxr,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/o0mv8z/colombian_huila_supremo_i_roasted_last_night/h2ltj5i/'

Occasionally we pay the big bucks to get a service tech here but only for major things that rarely happen. Most of the time we can handle service and repair. Ive taken apart the roasters more times than I can remember and know essentially everything. With the exception of the 23R. Not fond of having to take that apart.

Maybe if the boss isn’t around I can get a picture of the roaster here (we actually have two but one has been decommissioned).   I work in product development for the company spent about six months perfecting a cold brew that we produce in a 100 gallon tank. At the moment I’m working on a coffee syrup to test for reaction. If there is enough positive feedback and a demand we may consider putting it into a small scale production.   We roast utilizing a low carbon afterburner and are CO2 low emission certified.   My other role (unofficially) is equipment maintenance so I am also quite familiar with working on the various pieces of machinery. The only exception being any software related issues. That’s beyond my scope and that when we call the guy who “built / assembled” the roaster.

Extreme pain in the ass to get those installed. In my Maryland facility we brought them in through the roof with a crane.

h1ik1sa,2021-06-12 06:46:31,OkOutlandishness4439,ny73wx,Dark Roasts don’t taste truly dark?,Why is it that when I buy ‘Dark Roast’ from some small batch independent coffee roaster… it doesn’t taste nearly as dark and rich as my favs like Peet’s ‘Major Dickinsens’ or a Starbucks French Roast.

h1lppy4,2021-06-13 01:31:39,AromaticMatt,ny73wx,Dark Roasts don’t taste truly dark?,Hey I’m a little late to this but I think it’s important to remember that these big retailer stores will be roasting lower quality coffee darker. For them price of green coffee is really important and then roasting them dark is just their way of creating uniformity by imparting the “dark” flavour on the beans. For smaller specialty roasters who want to start roasting dark coffee they might be trying to roast high quality coffee dark. This would be a really interesting thing to compare IMO high and low quality dark coffee. Level of darkness seems to vary in stores.  Also worth considering is that some specialty roasters might be putting too much thought into their darker roasts- i was once working at a roastery where we had to develop a dark roast and it took a bit of training to make the team remove their specialty hat and put on their “we are just doing dark roasts and this might not be our favourite type of coffee” hats.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ny73wx/dark_roasts_dont_taste_truly_dark/h1lppy4/'
h1in88d,2021-06-12 07:16:56,fxja,ny73wx,Dark Roasts don’t taste truly dark?,I understand the retailers roast their coffee at higher temps in order to produce more beans. Also by the time one brews a retailers coffee its been roasted for weeks.   On the other hand smaller roasters tend to roast at lower temps for smaller batches. Also its likely been days not weeks when one gets to brew their coffee. So the taste will be smoother not stronger. One can wait longer for recently roasted coffees to note the taste changes.,h1ik1sa,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ny73wx/dark_roasts_dont_taste_truly_dark/h1in88d/'
h1ip76f,2021-06-12 07:34:50,Starkey73,ny73wx,Dark Roasts don’t taste truly dark?,I’m a barista but I’ve worked with roasters before and obviously hear a lot from customers. The common opinion is that Starbucks roasts their beans pretty dark. I’ve had to use espresso for my drip before. Maybe try that. I’m kind of curious myself. It’s been a long time since I’ve had Starbucks or Peet’s. If you try it make sure to update.,h1ik1sa,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ny73wx/dark_roasts_dont_taste_truly_dark/h1ip76f/'

I want the taste that I like from Peet’s/Starbucks but I want to give my dollars local/small bus. So trying to understand the difference. I know SOME small roasters have delicious ‘dark roast’ that seems to match. But then the next small roaster has their ‘dark roast’ and it’s completely different.

h1ita8y,2021-06-12 08:10:32,fxja,ny73wx,Dark Roasts don’t taste truly dark?,Agreed. The hotter the roast the darker and oiler the bean.

h1iv034,2021-06-12 08:25:34,thatjacob,ny73wx,Dark Roasts don’t taste truly dark?,Its more that you tend to lose the characteristic of the coffee that youre roasting and it tastes more like the roast process itself. Smaller roaster tend to use better beans and commercial dark roasting is a method to cover up inferior quality beans in most cases. Theyre capable of doing it but the darker you go the more that the differences between their cheaper competitors and their coffees diminish.,h1iug7u,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ny73wx/dark_roasts_dont_taste_truly_dark/h1iv034/'
h1jnq1o,2021-06-12 12:26:54,I_Got_A_Truck,ny73wx,Dark Roasts don’t taste truly dark?,I think I qualify as a small batch commercial roaster. I use a 12kg probat and roast a couple hundred pounds per week. Im most cautious about wasting beans. Each of my roasts yields 15 pounds and that can be a costly experiment. Also even after getting a roast to taste how I want it to taste it has to be worth it to fit in with my current product offering or a single customer has to purchase the whole batch. And your average coffee customer isnt going to buy 15 pounds of coffee at a time.,h1iug7u,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ny73wx/dark_roasts_dont_taste_truly_dark/h1jnq1o/'
h1iv0f6,2021-06-12 08:25:39,fxja,ny73wx,Dark Roasts don’t taste truly dark?,The latter. I roast at home and the beans roast much more quickly in smaller batches. Im a fan of the medium roasts and Ive noticed this flavor profile trending among the independent roasters. If youre a fan of the darker french roasts then see if your local roaster can get a batch for you up there.,h1iug7u,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ny73wx/dark_roasts_dont_taste_truly_dark/h1iv0f6/'

Once you get this stuff setup maybe bop in once a year with very little notice kinda like an audit and the rest is good to go.  Any travel cost to or from the farm is a tax deduction since it is the cost of doing business…  Edit:  While I loath k&n as a freight carrier on most levels their dictionary of international trade is quite a decent reference if you’re getting into it just now.

h0150d7,2021-05-30 17:33:47,Inaglasscage,nokamn,First batch ever! feedback is 🙏,One thing I do in the first minute is I keep the top off and use a chopstick to move the beans around at the bottom. I’ve noticed that the ones at the bottom can get stuck in the “dead spots” where there are gaps in the air holes for circulation. When they get stuck they get burned and using the chopstick method solves this problem. Once they lose enough moisture and get lighter I put the top on and continue roasting. That’s the only issue I have with my Freshroast otherwise I love it! Happy roasting 🙏🏽,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/nokamn/first_batch_ever_feedback_is/h0150d7/'
h00vr0w,2021-05-30 16:06:29,tdweaver,nokamn,First batch ever! feedback is 🙏,Not sure what your fan setting is throughout the roast. I usually start with 9 fan and 9 power and then around 2mins put the fan down to 7. And then you can play around with it after that. It helps to have the fan really high at the beginning because the beans are more dense. That helped my roasts look a lot more consistent/even.   The color looks pretty inconsistent so I would try that. But as it’s been said already it’s hard to tell from a picture. Let us know how it tastes!,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/nokamn/first_batch_ever_feedback_is/h00vr0w/'
h01bkak,2021-05-30 18:36:53,theBigDaddio,nokamn,First batch ever! feedback is 🙏,Looks really nice. I find that it looks darker through the glass than it actually is. I start fan 9 power 1-3 then start raising power every two minutes or so when the temp reaches about 350°. Then start dropping fan when you are close to first crack. Don’t go below 5 on the fan.

gzy2g7k,2021-05-29 21:57:41,SirRickIII,nnwpv2,Suggested beans for cold brew,I used to be in charge of cold brew at a cafe I worked at.   I always favoured a 1:7-8 ratio   And I had very delicious tea like outcomes with single origins out of Ethiopia and Kenya. There was one Kenyan coffee that tasted like straight up blueberry tea. It was absurd.   What I’ve found in my experience is that 8-9h is usually a good extraction time. Test hour by hour if you want to see what is perfect for your grind size/coffee  After 10h I start to notice it becoming over extracted and sometimes it even becomes slightly acidic. Which combined with the bitterness of over extraction is very odd.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/nnwpv2/suggested_beans_for_cold_brew/gzy2g7k/'

gzwz5o1,2021-05-29 15:12:43,TheOnlyTxLiberal,nnmx9t,Home roaster looking for better equipment,Second Freshroast. If youre used to air popper roasting Freshroast will be familiar.    You might consider upping your air popper game by investing in an original The Poppery (https://www.ebay.com/itm/254943291070) With this you can easily split the circuits for the heater and fan. Run the heater with a Router Speed Controller (https://www.harborfreight.com/router-speed-control-43060.html). Run the fan with a standard dimmer.  Youll have total manual control over the roast. Build a stand and add a meat thermometer/thermoprobe and you can watch temp in real time...  Deeper down the rabbit hole...  * All the above plus  * Temp meter $50-100 (https://artisan-scope.org/devices/meters/)  * Artisan freeware (https://artisan-scope.org/)  * Assume you have a PC...  Now you can manually control heat/fan against a pre-defined roast curve in real-time.    Or journey to the DEEP depths of the rabbit hole... The Poppery thermoprobe holder above Artisan SW and...  * A PID (https://www.instrumart.com/products/42934/fuji-electric-pxf4-temperature-controller)   * SSR (https://www.instrumart.com/products/5105/carlo-gavazzi-rm1e)  * Comm bridge from PID to computer (https://www.amazon.com/USB-RS232-TTL-Industrial-Protection/dp/B07L2VLY5D/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=rs485+to+usb&qid=1622325251&s=electronics&sr=1-8)  * and using Artisan software (freeware)    From there youll have complete control of your roasts - make a curve in Artisan and tell the PID to control the heat. Watch it happen. 5min roast to 410deg - yes.  15min roast to 440deg - yes.

The first two bullets are resolved as we already looked into that and its a viable construction method and the purpose of it is within the codes. An architect friend raised the distorting issue one without experience in these kinds of constructions to be fair but more expertise than me I assume. Thats why it got me thinking.

gzjwpq8,2021-05-26 12:43:11,bigsagebrush,nkliwn,Steel SIP panels for roastery building,The main point where heat would transfer to the walls/ceiling wouldnt be radiant heat from the machine in the room it would be the point where the hot stack exits the wall/roof - that would be my only worry and thats dependent on the type of roaster/afterburner youre using.  This would probably be an HVAC question because every roasters different and local building codes have different tolerances/clearances for this sort of thing - architects Ive talked to dont know the specifics of ductwork codes unless they specialize in kitchens or heavy industrial.      Id imagine if youre using pricey insulated ducting it should be pretty easy for almost any material. We have a metal roof and we installed an insulated thimble for an insulated double-wall stack I can basically touch the thing while the roasters running full blast - its crazy.,gzezj17,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/nkliwn/steel_sip_panels_for_roastery_building/gzjwpq8/'

gz84cg8,2021-05-23 18:18:45,VSOR2017,njlfxn,Chaf remaining in bean well after first crack completes,Additional movement should help remove some of that chaff. Shake them in a colander perhaps?   I switched from the stock chamber to one of the 12” razzo extensions on my sr800 and that made a huge difference for me. I hardly have any chaff left over now. Previously I was doing things like blasting beans with compressed air in a tube with multiple holes to let chaff escape on one side and a single hole large enough for the nozzle on the other end. That also led to some beans shattering depending on the roast level and pressure I was using.

The curves of two different style machines can look a lot different while still producing great roasts. You will want different styles of roast for different styles of coffee.

h6p5cjo,2021-07-27 05:09:31,Dettak,ncz58i,Starting a roastery,Its OK really not bad but not great either. The probes show 30 Celsius less than reality and not even probe exchange helped so we have to live with that. It vibrates on a lot of places so we had to tune it by balancing it on a side by silencing using rubber and tapes on doors and latches etc.  Regarding roasting it usually takes 2 roasts for the temperature to stabilize. The first roast usually shows much less degrees on the bean probe compared to subsequent roasts so you need to count with that otherwise you try to falsely compensate for the slowness and end up with a superfast roast. It does its job but I kind of miss repeatability. When its windy hot dry moist outside it acts differently mostly on air exhaust which influences the speed of roasting. Maybe its because we only have 8 cm exhaust pipes to the chimney so it could be our fault I dont know. Anyway it was the cheapest gas roaster for me for the size so its quite ok for the money I guess. Running for the 3rd year now with only minor repairs.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ncz58i/starting_a_roastery/h6p5cjo/'

gzgncy5,2021-05-25 18:28:53,Racer1,ncake0,Arc S roaster initial review,i roast on the arc 800 its a great little machine but i find that the bt sampling rate is too slow so you really have to predict what your beans are going to do every 5 seconds. also - let the roaster warm up so that bt/et are almost equal before putting in your first batch. letting it warm up/equalize will help a ton with consistency and the overall profile of a given roast. i only bring it up because it looked like your et was far below your bt in the graph you posted. also - reach out to c2c and see if they have a magnehelic pressure gauge that fits your roaster. i think the exhaust piping is all the same diameter so they should. it makes all the difference in knowing exactly what your airflow rate is instead of just going off the dial. enjoy the roaster!,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ncake0/arc_s_roaster_initial_review/gzgncy5/'
gzgta7b,2021-05-25 19:19:39,marrahm,ncake0,Arc S roaster initial review,Thanks.  I’ve learned a bunch since that first profile. You’re right on about warm up. Although BT and ET never get near equal on this little one a good 10 min soak at 400 gets them as close as they will get.   The S has a magnahelic stock - you are right on it usefulness. Trying to control the air with the hash marks on the damper would be a waste of time. That said - I’m leaving it alone while I learn to work the gas smoothly.   I haven’t seen too many issues with BT lag. At least I don’t think so. The settings C2C gave me that I posted worked really well but gave a pretty smooth curve. I have knocked them back a bit so I get more noise but I can also see ET dip at FC and a useful dBT in real-time.  I’ll pull them tomorrow and post if it’s helpful.,gzgncy5,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/ncake0/arc_s_roaster_initial_review/gzgta7b/'

gxpyt08,2021-05-11 05:24:24,traveler19395,n9uyn4,Shipping Green Coffee Beans,Standard green coffee size is 60kg sacks sometimes 50kg or 69kg (Brazil).  Bags can be jute burlap material or poly bags often with a plastic liner a nice GrainPro or Ecotact plastic liner if its good coffee.  Shelf life of green coffee is roughly 1 year though it depends on the coffee processing and storage which can make the range more like 6-18 months.  Storage at room temperature is fine. Deep freeze temperatures can drastically extend shelf life but is extremely rarely practiced because its not very practical. Storage humidity will be very important if the coffee is not sealed in plastic.  Most roasted coffee sold to consumers is packaged in a range from 200g to 500g. In the US 12 and 16oz are most common in metric countries 200 250 and 340g are common.  Shelf life for safety is practically limitless but for freshness of high quality coffees 1 month from roast date to sale date would be the high end targeting 1-2 weeks and the customer finishing the coffee within 4 weeks from roast date is more ideal.  Standard packaging is paper or plastic bags with a one way valve made specifically for roasted coffee they are extremely common.  Like green coffee storing them at room temperature is fine but done very specific ways keeping them in a freezer can preserve shelf life.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/n9uyn4/shipping_green_coffee_beans/gxpyt08/'
gxqbt2b,2021-05-11 07:13:03,hotd0gwater420,n9uyn4,Shipping Green Coffee Beans,Hiya I’m a US based certified Q Grader and roaster that works closely with a US based specialty green importer. Here’s some answers to your questions!   “What’s the shelf life of green coffee?” In short once harvested and packaged a green coffee will have a shelf life anywhere from 6 months to in my experience 1 year. It will not spoil after a year but it won’t taste as good either. There are many factors that play a role in a green coffees shelf life. How was it processed? What is its moisture content? What are the conditions of where it’s being stored (ie in a climate controlled space?) is it in a grainpro bag? Is it only in burlap? Alternatively is it being vacuum sealed? Is it being exposed to insects (meal moths)? In my experience I even saw a green coffees lifespan shorten because it was in a warehouse next to a window that sun came through. All of these questions play a big role in the shelf life of your coffee and will prolong or shorten its lifespan.   Whats the standard packaging (weight packaging material) for green coffee beans?): Materials are easier to answer. Your coffee should be packaged in a plastic grainpro liner free of holes. The grainpro should be zip tied at the top. The grainpro be put into either a jute/burlap sack with a VISIBLE and legible ICO number (standard requirement) or a sturdy cardboard box (not as standard but becoming a little more popular).  The weight packaged depends on what the standards are for your country. Some countries export a standard of 59 kg other countries 69 others 70. Do some research for standard export size in PR. I would also say this export size IS flexible. If you are exporting a high end micro lot  or something rare and exotic then at your own risk I would say it’s more commonplace and acceptable to export in smaller quantities. Really just research PR’s export standards and make the decision that makes sense for you.   “What’s the shelf life of roasted coffee?” Again how are you storing it? If it’s being stored in a vacuum sealed/airtight container a year is a safe bet. Some cafes are toying with freezing coffee in airtight/low humidity conditions. But generally speaking assuming you don’t have an airtight packaging system and are storing it in standard bags with a one way gas valve (like any bag on a shelf at a grocery store) your coffee will taste it’s BEST at 2-4 weeks off roast. It will still be servable up to 3 months off roast to your average consumer but a specialty consumer WILL notice a stale taste. Anything past 3 months I would have a hard time putting a stamp of approval on but I dk companies do it all the time.   “What’s the standard packaging for roasted coffee?” This depends on who you are selling to.  Retail bags are generally 12 oz/340grams. Some companies will sell 16 oz/456grams but that’s not as common.  Wholesale/bulk sold to cafes are generally packaged in 5 lb bags.  Packaging is where you can get creative and have fun! I suggest looking at Savor Brands or Pacific Packaging. The sky is the limit. At a minimum a brown lined craft bag with a foldable top is all you really NEED but it’s not ideal or secure if you’re to be shipping or selling in mass. Generally a plastic or paper bag with a one way gas valve and heat-sealed top and a pull-tab opening is what you want to look for.   “What is the ideal temperature to store roasted coffee beans?” A cool dark low humidity environment is best.   Best of luck in your endeavors! Make sure your farmers and producers are being paid fairly!

gy0bt9n,2021-05-13 11:37:47,regulus314,n9uyn4,Shipping Green Coffee Beans,Usually green coffee should be used within 1-2 years after harvest. 2 years is the maximum as long as its stored in a temperature and humidity controlled environment. The standard packaging weight depends on the country and importers. I think most Africans do 60kgs and South Americans do 69kg bags? Some even 50kgs. Those are the standards I often seen on importers lists. On what I see its better to use GrainPro or Ecotact brand bags or something similar for the inner packaging and jute sacks for the outside cover. Some importers also do 30kgs and airtight seal them.  For roasted beans the common weight for retail bags is 200g and 250g. Some Asian roasters do 100g also. The common on the US is 12oz bags. Roasters also do 1kg specifically for wholesale. The shelf life can reach up to 6 months (if stored properly and meticulously) but its better to consume the coffee within 2 months after roast date because the volatile flavors degrades slowly even on storage. You can also store it below -30C if you want but thats another discussion.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/n9uyn4/shipping_green_coffee_beans/gy0bt9n/'

I too own a couple of farms in el salvador from which I produce very high quality pacamara (1500 masl). What I have found is that you have to bring each roaster a sample of your finest. You also want to do a taste with a renown barista so you can get the scoring on paper. The point score will help you talk your product up with a potential buyer. You have to do all of this while you work out the transportation shipping storage logistics.

The Maragogype will have no problem selling as long as it is relatively defect free and good dry milling has been done.

How to get in with a local coffee shop.,The store owners can be divided into small groups: Owners that do their own roasting  Owners that buy the coffee already roasted Warehousing capacity Type of roasting machine they own All of these factors will affect what and how much they can buy from you. The big roasters (8oclock coffee) will buy your entire yield if you can get it to their loading dock. Provided you get them proof of the quality size of the bean number of imperfections per pound of coffee ect.  And as this may seem like a good deal to us the real producers the price you get for quintal Oro is not much better than if you sold it to the local processor in your home town. Then there is the cost of shipping which takes a big bite out of the profits.,gx3xayd,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/n5lbt4/coffee_importing_sales_distribution_how_to_get_in/gx4rude/'

I currently grind about 15-20 bags for each market I have 5 markets so selling them is pretty easy if I don’t sell all of them I just bring it to the next market. Some markets we sell out of ground coffee and that’s just the way it is. I offer to deliver if it’s close.

Commercial grinders draw a lot of Amps at startup so you have to upsize your inverter and use large gauge wiring for hookup. Works great though!

gwssji1,2021-05-03 09:28:29,thatjacob,n3xdb7,Power banks,Im kind of over my head in picking one out. I roast on a Diedrich IR-12 and need to find something at least powerful enough to let the roaster go through cool down procedures (20 mins minimum) to prevent drum warping in the event of a power failure mid roast.

gwuo9il,2021-05-03 17:49:39,coffeeandtrout,n3xdb7,Power banks,There are plenty of large scale UPS’s out there but they are very spendy. Where I previously worked we had 3-240K Scolaris that had a separate UPS for each as well as air tanks for each one (cheaper than UPS for air compressors). Each provided enough power and air to finish the roast and cool down the Roaster in order to properly shut down. The UPS’s took their power from the grid and switched over in less than a second. Plus they powered a 120 outlet at each Roaster so while waiting for power to come back on you could make a pot of coffee. Hell of a lot better than cranking a drum!,gwssji1,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/n3xdb7/power_banks/gwuo9il/'

The roast was shot but at least there wasnt a fire hazard and I didnt have to manually crank the drum with a stick so Ill count it as a win.  The owner of the company is a nice guy but kind of cheap so Im just going to push for a $100ish UPS which should buy me 5-10 minutes if Im not mistaken. That would at least be enough time to dump the roast in the cooling bin and let some hot air escape from the drum.,gwuo9il,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/n3xdb7/power_banks/gwuqjda/'

This doesnt mean our coffee is bad. We use Organic Specialty grade coffee only and our dark roast has a bold but flavorful taste do it. Doesnt have any burnt aromas. A lot of smaller roasts or coffee hipsters swear by lighter roasts which give more fruity and acidic tones & thats fine but thats not what sells. Our purpose eliminate systematic poverty in latin America. Which is why we choose to pay extremely high prices per lb for our coffee so that they can actually make a profit. But buying a few bags a month wont help them. We need to move volume to help them grow. So we buy hundreds of containers a year of greens from our farmers to help them grow and help the community.

gw1v3dn,2021-04-27 07:05:46,TheTapeDeck,mz91hl,Color or DTR%,Neither are really reliable at all. Both are useful for repeated roasts but neither give any of the information you find in the cup. Therefore neither are prescriptive for quality roasting.  This is not to say that “if you always go for DTRx or ColorY your coffee sucks.”  You will have coffee that tastes better on a hotter faster roast where there will be a darker exterior and a wider variation between exterior and ground color. You will have coffee that tastes best in a light roast and has sub-10% DTR because of inaudible early FC or no audible FC at all.  On the same roast curve one coffee will taste better at 16% DTR and another will taste better at 24% DTR.  Nothing is so cut and dry that empirical measurements are truly instructive. They’re just good for “this coffee was good on a 10 minute roast charging 400° and 15% DTR so we will repeat that.”  The cup is everything.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mz91hl/color_or_dtr/gw1v3dn/'
gy0ez26,2021-05-13 11:59:24,regulus314,mz91hl,Color or DTR%,I mostly smell the coffees to determine whether if I should drop them already especially if Im profiling it for the first time. My development time usually aims around 1min to 1min:30secs then I check the temperature if its also within the range of dropping (depends on origin). Though I only use those numbers as a guide for consistency batch by batch. Then cupping it after a day is always a must.      Yes my methods are somehow subjective because I rely on sensory most of the time but my personal goals in roasting is always to honor those terroir flavors in coffee and what our consumers usually search for whenever they buy from us.      Note.    DTR or Development Time Ratio is a different thing because it varies depending on the total length of your roasts. A 1min development time with an 8min total roast time will create a different DTR compared to a 1min development time with a 10min total roast time. So I dont think its best to use that as communication tool about roasts.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mz91hl/color_or_dtr/gy0ez26/'

gw23x1q,2021-04-27 08:10:14,sergeikutrovski,mz91hl,Color or DTR%,The cup is everything! And... quite subjective when it comes to flavor. I agree there’s no set DTR% or temp across the board. But what I am wondering is between color and development % what effects the flavor outcome more. Let’s say two coffees are roasted light (according to the agtron meter) but one has 15% DTR and another 20% what are you perceiving to have changed in the cup. Or... what if you roast to 18% DTR but do a light and a dark roast how drastic are the changes in the cup.,gw1v3dn,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mz91hl/color_or_dtr/gw23x1q/'
h4qg14v,2021-07-10 12:52:14,sergeikutrovski,mz91hl,Color or DTR%,I would counter the DTR statement and say your DTR is more important than development time because I believe there’s much more flavor impact in post-crack caramelization to rest of roast rather than just the amount of time of post-crack caramelization.,gy0ez26,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mz91hl/color_or_dtr/h4qg14v/'

gw26xgl,2021-04-27 08:31:38,TheTapeDeck,mz91hl,Color or DTR%,DTR isn’t a real “thing.” DTR will increase by percentage the same whether your RoR is 5°F/m or 15°F/m. Same coffee same DTR with those 2 late roast RoR will be unrecognizable as “same coffee.” So DTR is not really a metric that deals with the chemistry.

gvv45wc,2021-04-25 15:00:11,DonDonnelly,myf76z,How do you start a career in roasting?,As someone who didnt take this path see if you can find a local roaster willing to give you a few shifts even if you just start out packaging assisting etc. I pretty much just YOLOed into it and as fun as it has been I wouldnt necessarily suggest it.     From a technical standpoint there are differences between small batch home roasting and productions roasts but as far as Im concerned the bigger challenge comes from managing your green buying developing/maintaining your blend(s) and figuring out your place in the world of coffee. All of these things you can learn a lot from people that are doing it successfully and in my experience the ones that are really great at it are happy to teach.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/myf76z/how_do_you_start_a_career_in_roasting/gvv45wc/'
gvw0fr4,2021-04-25 19:55:27,TheTapeDeck,myf76z,How do you start a career in roasting?,There’s plenty of difference between home roasting and commercial roasting.  If you want to get into commercial roasting you will either need to get comfortable with a near min wage job at a coffee company or you’ll need to scrape together $30-50k depending on where you’re located and be prepared to get comfortable with a near minimum wage job at your own coffee company.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/myf76z/how_do_you_start_a_career_in_roasting/gvw0fr4/'

gxo4poo,2021-05-10 16:43:45,TheTapeDeck,myf76z,How do you start a career in roasting?,I subscribe to the idea that sometimes we will do things with our time because “this is what I need to do with my time.” Coffee is that for me. Music had been that for me but it doesn’t pay enough anymore without huge compromise. Anyway it’s not the worst thing that can happen. It’s not a high paying industry… it just isn’t. You have to move to a very expensive metropolis in order to make meaningful money and there it doesn’t get you as far. So coffee is a pretty awful place to raise a family etc if it’s not true love for you.  All of our Baristas make more than I do as an owner and roaster. I could change that and be greedy but it’s not right. It’s not our baristas’ fault that service work doesn’t pay super well. Everyone clears more than $15/hour (me just barely) and my main struggle is “how to I make sure I don’t break the bank on green coffee AND figure out ways to get the staff to my target hourly (which was $15 and then COVID made it clear that’s not enough.) It’s hard. Sometimes it’s not enough to know we have the best coffee in the area and to know we are trying to be conscientious buyers.   The money is not in roasting… its in service when you don’t work for scoundrels and you are in a location that has demand. There’s money in wholesale but you have to win clients and sometimes that’s easier to do once you’ve got a reputation and they come to you than by pounding the pavement.,gxo2ozm,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/myf76z/how_do_you_start_a_career_in_roasting/gxo4poo/'

We focus on single origins. I am looking at getting a commercial space down the road right now we do everything through my states cottage law. If I did not have a full time job already I could do more but I am trying to build a strong base. So far it’s working well. I’m not trying to do an online only subscription based thing.

gvtaamk,2021-04-25 05:49:22,audiofrequencywick,mxsmnm,Question - Pounds Per Month,I have done everything without any loans. Over this year I bought 2 roasters. My big issue is space. I started with a 1 pound sonofressco which is terrible to do 3-4 pounds an hour and that be your only machine.  I then got a aillio bullet which is good. But then we really started selling a lot of coffee so I got a 2lb sonofressco. I know people are like why didn’t you get a bigger drum roaster. But bigger drum roasters require space an dedicated area they are a lot of money. Also I don’t think we would use it to it’s full potential. I was looking at a 5kg roaster but realized until I have a commercial space I only have a few coffees that I roast that much of. We sell 10 different varieties of coffee and currently I may do 3kgs of one and 3 kgs of another but then 7kgs of our Guatemalan. I pull out the sonofresscos when it’s nice out and do all of our medium roasts on those then I keep the bullet inside and do our light and dark roasts on that. If I need to I can roast 140lbs of coffee in a day. My total cost on all 3 roasters was $7k over the last 8 months. I bought the first sonofressco for $1k used and invested and $3k of my own money for beans and business set up and now I’ve got two more roasters paid for by the business and about 800lbs of beans on hand grindertents for markets and everything else I could need and no debt and money in the bank from it.   Just do what you feel comfortable with. You really do need to figure out how to repay your supplies pay the business and pay yourself in every bag you sell.   Also keep in mind most farmer markets have started or already have their vendors so that may be a no go till next year.,gvs0qwk,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mxsmnm/question_pounds_per_month/gvtaamk/'

gvvvkg0,2021-04-25 19:08:44,audiofrequencywick,mxsmnm,Question - Pounds Per Month,The first sonofressco I bought used. The bullet I bought new and the second sonofressco I bought new but it was discounted and came with 46lbs of coffee that I am selling at one of my markets. I just got Sumatra fto and it’s really not bad. So the free 46lbs of of coffee gives me about $700 off because all I am paying for is bags and power to run the roaster.,gvte6dg,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mxsmnm/question_pounds_per_month/gvvvkg0/'

gvj5x3f,2021-04-22 21:33:58,ImJustRestless,mwms5a,Need some help promoting or selling coffee,So you bought a container of green coffee with no prospects to sell it? Did someone con you into purchasing this much coffee? How does this happen??   But seriously where are you located? You have to consider that any coffee roaster that is already operating has relationships with established green coffee importers who have a huge range of coffees available. Folks don’t just buy because a coffee is cheap there’s lot of other factors that go into a buying decision. Also depending how many coffee roasters are in your town you have to consider that they won’t all want to buy the same coffee. In my town there are dozens and dozens of roasters of all different sizes - and once one roaster has a coffee you won’t find more than a couple more that will carry that same coffee.  I wish you the best of luck,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mwms5a/need_some_help_promoting_or_selling_coffee/gvj5x3f/'
gvk6l0r,2021-04-23 05:46:16,garyluisborges,mwms5a,Need some help promoting or selling coffee,First of all F.  Second of all you are slightly in luck. There are major supply chain issues in coffee at the moment as COVID ripples through the container shipping world. Somewhere out there is a roaster struggling to get the coffee they need at the price they can afford. You have to just hop on the phone and start calling every roaster you can find explaining the situation you are in and offering them a hot deal. Hopefully someone will bite. Not sure what you paid for the coffee but you will probably have to sell at least some of it at a loss. Better to offload as much as you can though before it sits and stales for a year. Good luck! Btw how much would you be willing to sell for and where is the coffee located?,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mwms5a/need_some_help_promoting_or_selling_coffee/gvk6l0r/'

gy0g7j8,2021-05-13 12:07:49,regulus314,mwms5a,Need some help promoting or selling coffee,Maybe try calling and emailing all roasters in your state and not just in your area. Maybe even around your state. You can also try posting in roasting forums online for home roasters. Youll surely get someone since your coffees are also traceable with official papers and since the supply chain from origin these days are a bit slow due to covid.      Then again why do you have so many Chiapas without considering on how to sell all of them when they landed in your warehouse? If you wanted to start a roasting business its also better if you have a variety of origins with you.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mwms5a/need_some_help_promoting_or_selling_coffee/gy0g7j8/'

Ive had 3 different roasters profile it each with different results at different levels however its been noted as cereal liquor chocolate raisin nutty from one grader milk chocolate almond from a different roaster and floral/citrus from another grader at light roast and sweet aroma/tangerine at med light.

gvb87q5,2021-04-21 04:21:30,xkinggk,mv7mjs,What are your big problems with coffee roasting?,We roast on 2 Probat G-120s. Biggest trouble Id say is cleaning. Not really problem but a pain in the ass to do. Our newer roaster Probat 23R has this self clean feature which is great. Another is when coffee we have stored at another warehouse isnt cared for properly and the coffee comes with signs of pest which we have to toss or the beans arent what they were.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mv7mjs/what_are_your_big_problems_with_coffee_roasting/gvb87q5/'

gz29kwh,2021-05-22 08:17:50,lancechen,mv7mjs,What are your big problems with coffee roasting?,How much coffee do people in your country drink do you think? I wonder the reason why there are only two importers is because people dont drink that much of coffee maybe? So here in Taiwan I can easily find several retailers selling green beans from all over the world on shopee and I think there are at least three large importers and some smaller ones. And there are independent and chained coffee stores all around the big cities here.,gynxk71,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mv7mjs/what_are_your_big_problems_with_coffee_roasting/gz29kwh/'
gz5905s,2021-05-23 02:35:54,regulus314,mv7mjs,What are your big problems with coffee roasting?,Were a coffee drinking country actually. The specialty coffee scene here in PH only started like 2014. The coffee shop businesses was and still growing steadily right now but not everyone buys and uses specialty grades and since the country also grows both Arabica and Robusta most shops especially the very small ones tend to buy local grown but not all local grown can still go on par with what coffees like in Ethiopia and Colombia can offer. I can think of only 3 coffee companies (we also have a partnership with one of them) that really work direct with local farmers in order to elevate their crop quality/export their coffees and there are probably only around 25 shops that I can guarantee focuses on what quality coffee is and most of them also buys from different large international importers.      Im not really sure why no one yet opens up a large coffee importing company here. Some say its due to corruption and customs puts up more taxes on imported green coffees. Still there are a few roasters also that offers green coffees to sell but we wanted variety on our selection and not be the same with everyone else.,gz29kwh,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mv7mjs/what_are_your_big_problems_with_coffee_roasting/gz5905s/'
gzpfb3j,2021-05-27 18:09:33,lancechen,mv7mjs,What are your big problems with coffee roasting?,We also have local farmers growing coffee here in Taiwan but the quantity is far less than imported green and the price is at least 3x more expensive. Maybe the fact that you have more locally grown greens in PH is the reason why there is less demand for imported greens especially arabica that has richer flavor.

gy3g2kb,2021-05-14 06:08:14,regulus314,mtjfvx,Question: would a baked coffee have more weight loss than a non-baked coffee?,Hmmm likely the non baked coffee (I assume the 12mins) will lose more weight than the baked one (the 18mins). Even if the baked coffee took longer. Also I dont think you can achieve the same end temperature for both since you need to achieve a specific temperature for the beans in order to achieve first crack (which as I said the stage where the coffee loses most of its weight).,gy0okcv,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mtjfvx/question_would_a_baked_coffee_have_more_weight/gy3g2kb/'

Its all BPA free Food Grade Heavy duty. I called and spoke to the distributers in Oregon (a lovely older couple) and I will be getting my shipment in by early next week. Everything they are talking about is exactly what I use down to the oxygen absorbers. So I hope you find this helpful and maybe Ill post some images upon receipt of my lids.

gtyiurf,2021-04-09 11:21:38,geezusmurphy,mnllmu,Greens for darker roasts,Love the Costa Rican SHB EP Tarrazu La Pastora and the Brazil Mogiana from Burman dark roasted.  Both under $5/lb.

gu1yw87,2021-04-10 09:03:18,intensive-porpoise,mnllmu,Greens for darker roasts,Id always use a Catuai Natural from Brazil if I needed to go anywhere near second or occasionally a Castillo from Colombia. Indonesians are also more suited for that spectrum. Single Origin Espresso from Timor sounds rough but aged out 15 days its as smooth as glass and really wonderful on its own.   Some lower grade Ethiopian washed coffees produce an interestingly artificial cherry note when taken pretty dark almost like how Dr. Pepper has a black cherry quality to it. You wouldnt use that flavor as its defining feature but its there and can be good.  Island coffees or even Centrals milled/dried too close to lakes also work well. Ive taken some Coban coffees close to France and it was unexpectedly very much like a Japanese Whiskey full of intriguing and swampy peat-like depth.   There is a perfect roast level for a coffee depending on its origin and life story. Some roasters constantly go light with everything which is sort of like the 1990s when everyone took coffee too dark. There is a Yoda quote in here somewhere.  I like carbon (occasionally) as a tool in my belt to modify a roast and there is only one way to get there. Sometimes you gotta take it right to the cusp of 2nd. Sometimes. But dont tell anyone I do that or they will come and repossess the artfully geometrically subway tiles and the wicker sculptures from my cafe.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mnllmu/greens_for_darker_roasts/gu1yw87/'

Unsweetened black,Too light (thin) = not enough coffee:water or not enough time too coarse a grind or too low temp for brewing.   But I highly recommend that you a) go someplace that makes really good coffee and good cold brew to set your expectations b) buy better beans c) spend a week trying to dial in your tastes.   I am big on the side of everybody has their own taste for what they like in coffee and theres nothing wrong with liking coffee one way or another. Folks that get super into coffee rules get pretty tedious pretty quick. And Ive had a job with free decent coffee. BUT: Coffee can be so much better and theres so much more that you could enjoy. Its like drinking a good craft brew after a lifetime of Budweiser: there are many more flavors there. I still drink Bud from time to time but theres a whole world past that door.   If youre in LA Ill gladly buy you cuppa try to help you figure out what you like and what you dont about any given cold brew. Until then the best advice I can give you is that anywhere in America theres a local cafe that makes a great cold brew for you but its really down to what you like.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mjz0fa/best_store_bought_iced_coffee_unsweetened_black/gtfgwjn/'

gt8yv3q,2021-04-03 07:39:51,intensive-porpoise,mixo75,Can anyone point me to an accurate wireless/WiFi thermometer that can be immersed in the beans as they are being tossed around in the drum?,Ive gone down this rabbit hole and spent far too much money. Here are the few things that Ive found that work for seeing inside a drum.   (Yes I even had a somewhat working Pyrex drum constructed out of an old British Bybee model)  - Infrared cameras   These are awesome do the trick but need processing power to be useful and in real-time. I have three Raspberry Pi (4) units operating six cameras. For the first few months every day is like Christmas especially when you can watch the beans turn color at 1st crack and really see the endo/exo process but the amount of data gathered is somewhat limited. Like it just shows you what youd expect - unless something is very wrong which is a good failsafe I suppose.  LiDar-  Im still learning from this. It is wild. It is a little expensive but basically uses light radiation as radar. So in terms of watching your bean mass change in absolute real time (and watching it move faster as there is less H20) there really is no comparison. You can even program it to colorize by the degree. Finally and perhaps most important it tracks the speed of chaff and air-flow.    These arent probably useable in very small machines I have them in a 12 and 15 kilo. But maybe there would be some helpful data gained.... The forces and physics change so much in under 5k that the machines are practically different.   I havent ever used or tried in-house sensors like you suggested that would drop in with the mass. Ive always wanted to but until tell sensory and affordable computing power speed up to real time it might just be an agonizing experience.,gt84d6g,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/mixo75/can_anyone_point_me_to_an_accurate_wirelesswifi/gt8yv3q/'

gqxgw1e,2021-03-14 12:12:15,HIVEROASTER,m4xzjg,Artisan Software,Once you have it installed you will need to configure it to match your roaster.  Brand type or in the case of a phidget the model of phidget you use.    Once you have it configured you need to click on before you will see temps displayed.  Once you do that you start a roast by hitting start.  A funny thing about the program is that if you are at room temperature you wont see a graph because the graph starts at 100f so the graph is there but actually below the screen.  If you get to this point you can do as many dry runs as you want to check it out.  There are lot of configurations to set screen appearance what graphs it displays as well as a refresh setting which determines how it deals with the rate of rise calculations.  It works pretty well other than the two buttons which appear to allow you to zoom and scroll. Anytime I try and deal with these buttons it goes nuts and I lose my position on the screen and have no idea what is happening.  &#x200B  Good luck we are blessed to have a freeware solution that works so well.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/m4xzjg/artisan_software/gqxgw1e/'

gqwdyut,2021-03-14 07:24:49,chenglish,m4e5bi,Best green bean seller for home roasters?,Lot of good options mentioned but I always like pointing out [Genuine Origin](http://www.genuineorigin.com). Definitely larger quantities than the ones listed (they only have 65lb options) so your upfront cost is greater. But the shipping is only $10 or free if its on special and they ship UPS. Lots of great coffee at a lot of different prices and sometimes you can get lots from the previous season on sale. Im a professional roaster and we use them to tie us over when we face freight/timing issues for some of our beans from importers but if you dont mind the higher upfront cost and quantity then I think theyre a great option to consider for home roasters.,-,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/m4e5bi/best_green_bean_seller_for_home_roasters/gqwdyut/'

At those qualities we have also used https://www.genuineorigin.com/ with their 65lbs (iirc) boxes which are pretty easy to handle. GO offers samples so you can sample it before purchasing and Sweet Maria/Coffee Shrub gives me better notes but no samples.,gqw05fu,/r/coffee_roasters/comments/m4e5bi/best_green_bean_seller_for_home_roasters/gqxb3wm/'
