i50dzx3,2022-04-16 15:19:03,Harrywuzhere,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,So I tried cupping it today alongside two other beans I got from the same (local) roaster. And it appears you were right. All were rather bland and boring. This was my first foray into specialty coffee so I think I’ll make some orders from more well known roasters.

i50e3o8,2022-04-16 15:19:49,Anomander,u57nxn,Coffee roaster/cafe numbers,What are you thinking of by “well to do”?  The *most* successful cafe in any given city likely has factors like several locations and/or a roastery backing it - they might make millions.   A more typical successful cafe is pulling between $50k and $150k annually typically split into an ownership pool of 2-5.    Keep in mind that most *successful looking* cafes are not pulling those sorts of numbers.  It’s important to look successful in order to draw in customers so many places that look like they’re thriving are definitely not but still needing to maintain the illusion.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u57nxn/coffee_roastercafe_numbers/i50e3o8/'

i50uj5r,2022-04-16 17:25:31,wipny,u4ukr7,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yes it’s a very noticeable upgrade in terms of speed and grind consistency.   I used a Hario Skerton for 5 years or so and upgraded to a 1Zpresso JX about 2 years ago.   It’s built solid of a single piece of anodized aluminum. I use it daily for pour over and AeroPress and it’s been a pleasure to use.   I can grind 15g of light roasted Ethiopian beans to a Kosher salt grind in 20 seconds. Grinding the same beans with my old Hario would’ve been a terrible 4 minute arm and wrist workout with the grinder skipping around and me taking multiple breaks.   My only minor complaint with the JX is the rubber grip sleeve. Mine loosened up after 10-11 months where it slips out of place when I grip it while grinding.   I contacted 1Zpresso last year right before my 1 year warranty was up and they suggested to remove and clean the sleeve with soap and water and wipe down the metal underneath of oils and dirt. That didn’t help.   There was another tip I read about soaking the rubber sleeve in a baking soda water solution and letting it dry so it develops a chalky film for grip. That only helped temporarily.  I’ve seen this rubber sleeve issue common from other JX and JX Pro owners without a solution. The company needs to switch the rubber material or get rid of it altogether.,i50lgio,/r/Coffee/comments/u4ukr7/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i50uj5r/'

I get up grind put water in an Oxo drip coffee maker move the ground beans to a paper filter put the filter in the machine and press start.   It takes about ten or fifteen minutes with my grinder for the static electricity that is generated from the grinding to dissipate. If I wait that long transferring the ground coffee is clean and tidy. If I don’t wait the static charge means the grounds make a mess.

i510302,2022-04-16 18:09:45,Way-Famous,twp5a6,I am a beginner and I finally figured out why my coffee always turned out bitter - its the goddamn tap water,Water can be even crazier than that ... heres one coffee and one non coffee story:  1. Inexpensive major brand two mug drip machine with thermos. At home great. At work the first mug out of the thermos is just like home... great! However the 2nd mug poured out of the thermos about 20 minutes later is horrible. I tried decanting the 2nd mug early so it wasnt sitting in the thermos... no change the 2nd mug was still undrinkable. Tried a different coffee machine (borrowed) with MY thermos tasted great. Tried my machine and thermos with my own water... tasted great. So the combination of that drip machine PLUS that particular tap water PLUS several minutes of time for the chemistry to settle was the killer. 2. I had a fresh water fish tank. Every week or two I changed water and adjusted the pH. Killed a few fish. One day after adjusting the new waters pH I stalled a few hours and checked the pH just to be safe itd drifted significantly. Adjusted again waited a couple of hours it drifted again adjusted again and finally after several hours it was stable. The Fish Store owner said I was crazy... two years later I was in his store and he was telling someone dont use West Acton (MA) water theres something weird going on there... I was vindicated. Again it wasnt just the combination there was an elapsed time contributor to the problem.  I should ask George Howell (his roastery is on the East side of Acton Im on the West side) what water he uses for tastings at the roastery. Acton has several wells and depending on which part of town youre in and what day it is you may be getting a different mix of well waters. I keep a 5 gal Poland Springs for coffee just to minimize the variations I would otherwise have no control over.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/twp5a6/i_am_a_beginner_and_i_finally_figured_out_why_my/i510302/'

i4yf4pu,2022-04-16 06:36:32,mysticcoffeeroaster,u4kzri,Do green coffee beans smell good? or bad? or anything?,I find that the green aroma is a good indicator of the quality of the coffee. Its also an indicator of how the green was processed. Dry processed coffees usually but not always smell fruity or floral. Wet or washed coffees usually but not always smell more like grass or hay.  My favorite coffee to roast is a nice dry processed Ethiopian with floral and fruity notes. When I open the bag of green and it smells like a wine cellar (pleasant not too fermented) or a flowery meadow I know I have a good one. If it smells like soup or grass its OK but nothing special. If it smells like a swamp or a wet basement I send it back.  Most good quality South American beans have a hay or grassy smell. Some of the better South and Central American growers are learning how to process green to get different flavors like floral strawberry & citrus and that definitely reflects in the green aroma.  A lot of the Indonesian and Southeast Asian green coffees smell like feet to me. Sometimes it disappears when roasted and sometimes it doesnt. Most Sumatras Ive had smell a little bit fermenty which isnt necessarily a bad thing.  But no matter the origin or processing method anything resembling moldy is bad.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u4kzri/do_green_coffee_beans_smell_good_or_bad_or/i4yf4pu/'

(because I was going through so much distilled water and Third Wave packets).  Once I started making my own water (for coffee...) I found I prefer to dial things back even further but the jump from my (fairly hard) tap water to Third Wave was enormous.

All my coffees were bad. Is third wave water a gimmick or am I missing something.,Nice to hear you enjoyed our coffees!  Hm. I am now leaning towards you just needing to make a grind adjustment (a bit finer) because the softer water (TWW especially at less than full strength) doesnt extract flavor as easily as harder water does so in order to get the chocolate notes you need to boost extraction by grinding finer. Or use more water for the same amount of coffee. Or increase water temperature.,i4wdu17,/r/Coffee/comments/u4i1vm/third_wave_water_hi_i_just_tried_third_wave_water/i4wesby/'

i4vhci6,2022-04-15 13:13:39,Aukk,u4dtuv,Have anyone here tried to grow Coffee Plants,For sure coffee plants are super easy to grow if you dont care about the taste of the coffee.  I would suggest a Robusta plant..super hardy.    Getting a good flavor is a different animal.  Plants are grown at altitude because of the huge swings in temperature every day.   It stresses out the plant and when it gets stressed it shuffles its nutrients/proteins (yummy bits) to its protected center/roots of the plant....then when it warms up all the yummy stuff gets shuffled out to the beans....where the plants believe it really needs to help its offspring in such a shitty climate.  This constant shuffling of yummy bits to the seed/bean is what makes complex flavors.  If you grow it in a stable happy environment the plant thinks it will thrive so it doesnt help out its baby/bean.  Not very yummy.  Its a balance of stressing out your plant while still maintaining a good yield.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u4dtuv/have_anyone_here_tried_to_grow_coffee_plants/i4vhci6/'

In South Florida its no problem North Florida it probably isnt even worth trying.  I grow a couple Arabica plants in Orlando but I dont think they would do too well much farther north. They are very tender plants when it comes to cold. People I have talked to around here say that they have had coffee plants die back to the ground if it gets at all below freezing though they do usually grow back.   At the same time though it is definitely possible to get cherries off of them given 1) patience 2) some luck with the weather and 3) potentially a bit of effort covering the plants if its going to get below say 35°F,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u4dtuv/have_anyone_here_tried_to_grow_coffee_plants/i4vwza3/'

i4yhxoq,2022-04-16 07:00:03,mysticcoffeeroaster,u4dtuv,Have anyone here tried to grow Coffee Plants,Just so you know coffee grown at low elevation is considered low quality coffee though I have to admit Ive never knowingly tasted low elevation coffee to know what that tastes like. It is said the sweet range for good coffee is 4000-6000 feet above sea level. Also coffee plants are understory plants which means they like shade.  I had some coffee plants as house plants. They loved it indoors but the New England Winter was hard on them since it gets super-dry inside. Unfortunately I killed them when I put them outside in the Summer and they got a couple of days of direct sunlight. They were even under a tree but the sun got to an angle where it was shining directly on them and I didnt realize. After the first day I noticed there was some browning so I watered them. After the 2nd day they were completely brown & dead. It happened so fast! I dont know what variety they were. I had them about 5 years. They made a few flowers the last couple of years and one of them made one bean! Anyway you might want to start out with just a couple or few of them to make sure they will survive on your land before you go whole hog.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u4dtuv/have_anyone_here_tried_to_grow_coffee_plants/i4yhxoq/'

i4ynh4q,2022-04-16 07:43:26,SolidDoctor,u4dtuv,Have anyone here tried to grow Coffee Plants,Another point to consider is how much coffee would you have to grow in order to make it worth your while to process it?  It can take a coffee farmer 8 hours to pick beans that will result in about 2 lb of coffee.  So in order to end up with enough quality product and be consistent you would need a lot of trees.    If youre just interested in the plant by all means grow one!

Most of these bushes are planted at less than 1000 above sea level but the temperate and foggy in the summer climate makes for a long growing season. The plants are primarily planted as a secondary crop amongst avocado trees. Most of the beans are Gesha and upwards of $200 per pound.

i4yhbeu,2022-04-16 06:54:55,Notspherry,u4dtuv,Have anyone here tried to grow Coffee Plants,I used to work as a R&D engineer for a company that builds vertical farms so I feel somewhat qualified to answer your question.  The short answer: Can you? Absolutely. Would it make economical sense? No.  Protected horticulture (greenhouses) and especially vertical farms is a very capital intensive way of growing plants. Energy as you rightly point out is a big one. Others are the greenhouse itself lighting (especially LED) HVAC irrigation...  The benefits can also be huge. Tomato yield in Spain is 8.5kg/m2. In Dutch greenhouses the average is over 50kg/m2. This is among other factors due to a closely controlled climate and  plants that are closer together.  Another factor is transportation. If your produce is bulky or fragile transportation costs can be high. Here you might offset the high cost of growing with the cost of a refrigerated truck transporting mostly air.  Coffee plants are big so you wont have many layers in a given height. They take several years to mature and then they can only be harvested once a year. Dried coffee beans are very easy and cheap to transport. All these things are negatives for vertical farming.  To be fair the only things that make economical sense right now for vertical farming are lettuce and fresh herbs. Small plants a few weeks between seeding and harvest quite expensive pound for pound quick to expire so you need them to be on the shelves very fast.  What I can imagine to be worthwhile is growing coffee in poly tunnels in areas that are a bit to cold and arid for normal growing.  I left a lot of stuff out here so if you want to know more please ask.  &#x200B  ETA: So I just read that under the right circumstances robusta can be harvested 2-3 times per year. That is better but still nowhere near enough I think.,i4xoyc1,/r/Coffee/comments/u4dtuv/have_anyone_here_tried_to_grow_coffee_plants/i4yhbeu/'

And I never tried coffee but is there any coffee grounds or cream similar to hot chocolate?,If you aren’t already a coffee drinker I would start with something other than a pourover. French Press is probably a good entry point.  Pourovers are labor intensive and finicky. The process is going to discourage you from making coffee regularly enough to develop a taste for it (because it *is* an acquired taste) - and since you don’t have a palate that’s used to coffee you won’t be able to get your recipe/technique dialed in since you won’t be able to taste the difference between good and bad cups. Additionally a French Press is going to give you a coffee with heavier body (think thicker mouthfeel… not as heavy as milk but less thin like water). If you want your coffee to taste like hot chocolate you’re going to be adding a lot of sugar cream and chocolate flavor/syrup - but you’re also going to want a heavier body to start with. One of the most common complaints I hear from new coffee drinkers is how things the beverage is vs. what they expected it to be like - and a French Press helps alleviate some of that perception shock.  Lastly I’ve got to be the asshole and ask… if you want something that tastes like hot chocolate and aren’t currently a coffee drinker why don’t you just pursue making really good hot chocolate and leave coffee out of the equation?,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u4de2f/i_want_to_start_making_pour_over_coffee_at_home/i4v0rri/'

Not the best coffee Ive ever had but its always consistent and never tastes bitter or burnt (at least the locations near me).  Ive found most places will have bad coffee if they arent set up to make fresh coffee regularly...Most burger joints around me arent. Subway also comes to mind.

i4ydcfc,2022-04-16 06:21:05,ride_whenever,u4bqzx,What is the restaurant/fast food place that has had the best coffee or the worst coffee?,>	small coffee shops  So I’ve noticed something generally the less diverse the coffee shop the worse the coffee. It’s like a mix of ethnicities results in a more balanced cup.    You pop into an *italian* small coffee shop you’ll often get undrinkable crap. But this seems to hold true for any non-diverse shop. The Serbian cafe I tend to go to after work isn’t great coffee but is a great space and does mean panini.

i4v1zeo,2022-04-15 11:24:59,vinylwhiskeyesq,u49g3v,Can anyone give me any information on this little pot I picked up the other day?,As to the valve you can probably feel it with your finger or alternatively press it with a paperclip to see if it moves. If it moves its probably working. The whole idea is that if pressure builds up too much inside the basin the pressure will press the valve and release steam. Otherwise you basically have a steam bomb which would be very bad.  For cleaning out the inside I recommend two items:  * A descaler like Dezcal which serves the same function as your lemon juice mixture but is much stronger. It is specifically designed for descaling coffee machines.  * A coffee machine cleaner like Urnex. This is going to be more for the coffee oil residue on the other pieces besides the basin.  No clue on the age but I would assume its at least from the 60s.,i4uofad,/r/Coffee/comments/u49g3v/can_anyone_give_me_any_information_on_this_little/i4v1zeo/'

i4uapzf,2022-04-15 08:21:08,BeanMazz,u496ef,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,Three good coffees this week:  [Onyx Movement](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/movement) \- Blend of washed and natural Ethiopian heirloom that’s part of Onyx’s artist series this one a collaboration with dancer/choreographer Vinh Nguyen. I brewed this exactly as Onyx recommended 1:15 with two pours at a medium fine grind though I used an Origami for a larger dose and it came out well. Not overly complex but very strong deep blueberry with the characteristic smoothness and silky body of Onyx’s better blends.  [Phoenix Koji Supernatural](https://phoenixcoffee.com/shop/exposures-2022-series-1-kojil) \- One of three coffees I’ve been brewing lately that have [Koji fermentation](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb0upQQLNYf/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) this one from Phoenix has a very pronounced berry wine flavor with maybe the most explicit notes of ferment similar to some anaerobics. The difference with this coffee is that it’s more pleasant and not off putting though it does need to be brewed carefully. I found that brewing this in the Next Level brewer at 1:14 with bypass to 1:17.5 gave me the most balanced cup and I got more of the watermelon and light strawberry indicated in their description.  [Memli El Vergel Koji](https://www.memlicoffee.com/product-page/colombia-el-vergel-koji-natural) \- Another coffee with Koji processing this one a red bourbon (also have Manhattan’s Koji gesha and the Phoenix coffee listed above). This might be the most interestingly complex of the three coffees the blend of stone fruit and grape and some dark berries comes together very well (with no off notes) and I really enjoyed how easy this was to brew and drink. As with the Phoenix Koji I brewed this in the Next Level which mutes acidity slightly relative to other brewers and brings out the body which works well for more processed coffees.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u496ef/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i4uapzf/'

i4upgiu,2022-04-15 10:00:45,geggsy,u496ef,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,As I have been writing about during the last few weeks I have been truly enjoying a lot of coffee from Rogue Wave in Canada lately (see for example [these two fantastic coffees from Colombia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/th2epo/comment/i16gw5i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) or [this lovely washed coffee from Finca Carmen in Panama](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/comment/i3wz4p5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).  However the two Im going to write about this week while still good havent been quite as good (at least for my preferences).     First up: [a washed coffee from the Layo Teraga co-op in Guji Uraga Ethiopia](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-layo-teraga-heirloom-washed).  Like many washed coffees from Ethiopia this past season I found that this coffee has an enjoyable and sweet apricot note.  That said even after dialing this in I wasnt able to coax much more out of this coffee into the cup so it left me thinking that this was a solid coffee if somewhat unexceptional for specialty coffee from Ethiopia.  If you like this type of cup profile and are buying from Rogue Wave I would definitely recommend the washed coffee from Finca Carmen in Panama instead.  It is the same price and a similar flavor profile but so much more nuanced delicious and complex.    Second up: [a Piramide naturally-processed coffee from Alberto and Diego Guardias Hacienda Sonora in Costa Rica](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/costa-rica-hacienda-sonora-centroamericana-piramide-natural).  I couldnt pick out the advertised tasting notes of mango cherry chocolate or banana in this one but instead just a general natural-processed fruity sweetness.  While enjoyable I couldnt help but compare it with [another natural from Colombia I had at the same time roasted by Nomad coffee in Spain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/tnxcbs/comment/i25e9tt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which I preferred because not only did it have that dense fruitness but also syrupy mouthfeel and a long finish.  I didnt get those things out of the coffee from Hacienda Sonora.  All-in-all these two werent my favourite offerings from Rogue Wave but maybe it was user error?  I have really enjoyed quite a few of their coffees in the past.     Speaking now of coffees I have enjoyed this week but didnt brew myself - I had a hauntingly delicious espresso made from coffee from the [Dumerso washing station in Ethiopia and roasted by Radio Roasters](https://radioroasters.com/products/ethiopia-dumerso-spontaneous-fermentation) in the USA.  The espresso shot was beautifully sweet fruity and bright.  It was really more-ish - it made me want more and more of it! But.... I was already sufficiently caffeinated so drinking more would have been a foolish (if delicious!) decision.  I also tried it with a touch of milk in a cortado as I thought its dense fruitness might pair well with the richness of steamed whole milk but espresso was totally the way to go with this one.  Usually after I drink an espresso I think that was delicious I wonder what other coffee I can enjoy as espresso.  However this espresso was different - it made me want to have that very same espresso again and again.  Hauntingly memorable.  I dont know if it has something to do with the process which the roaster calls spontaneous fermentation and sounds like a semi-washed process to me.  In any case I look forward to drinking this one again soon!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u496ef/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i4upgiu/'

Its the infamous SL28 variety so the cup was a pretty Kenyan-like experience with plenty of red fruits savoriness and herbality. A bit of chocolate to the cup as well with some nice sweetness almost reminiscent of a graham cracker. Pretty decent overall.  [El Floripondio natural processed Bolivia](https://blendincoffeeclub.com/product/el-floripondio/) from BlendIn Coffee Club out of Sugar Land Texas. This one is actually a straight batian variety and it acts a lot like my previous experiences with eugenioides coffees. Almost super artificial sugar tasting to the point where it reminded me of a bowl of mixed berry cereal with a spoon of sugar. Slight bit of dessertiness to it it was interesting.  [Finca Carmen washed processed Panama](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/panama-carmen-estate-caturra-washed) from Rogue Wave Coffee Roasters out of Edmonton Alberta. Saw a comment on this coffee last week and I agree with a lot in the sense that I think this is a very good coffee in general. Often times I feel Panama gives any variety a bit of a boost. Nice sweetness pretty clean mostly reminded me of a sugar cookie with some secondary stone fruit characteristics. Only thing keeping this coffee from being even better was a slight bit of smokiness I was getting.

The Layo is definitely like you said enjoyable solid and not complex. Very easy drinking type of Ethiopia washed. Definitely not as complex as Finca Carmen.   For the Sonora this coffee is so weird to roast. We would do almost exactly the same roast and one batch would turn out more fruity than the other while the other one would have more of that darker natural processed fruit sweetness you described. Always good for us to learn how our customer find the coffees.   Thank you for trying our coffee and hopefully the next would would be more memorable like your previous rounds :).,i4upgiu,/r/Coffee/comments/u496ef/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i4uy95a/'

i4u2gwk,2022-04-15 07:22:53,Ex-Spectator,u465h3,Why does my coffee smell strongly of parmesan cheese?,Often these experimental lots use fermentation to produce wild profiles and list them as “Anaerobic” process or something similar. These coffees can range from tropical & pleasant to funky & cheesy to strawberry balsamic-y. One component that makes it funky is the development of butyric acid during the fermentation process which can give you that cheesy almost baby pukey smell/flavor if not done properly. Mix that with a particular roast & extraction and there you go. There’s good ones and bad ones out there so experimental sure fits!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u465h3/why_does_my_coffee_smell_strongly_of_parmesan/i4u2gwk/'

I think people typically dont realize that most washed coffees are fermented but the fermentation is a lot shorter and more controlled than natural fermentation so you do not typically get flavors that we normally associate with fermentations (funky/boozy fruits cheese etc).

i4vdq3j,2022-04-15 12:47:45,mazamorac,u465h3,Why does my coffee smell strongly of parmesan cheese?,Fermentation is absolutely necessary for your coffee its not a gimmick.  Most people dont realize that without some sort and amount of fermentation you wouldnt be able to consume the majority of what you eat.  Fresh fruit? If its ripe its ready in good part thanks to your friendly yeast and fungus that does it for you. Thats why fruits in the tropics taste so amazing while imported fruit in the US will rot before ripening: not the right endemic microorganisms nor humidity and temperature.  Most know about cheese and beer but did you know that all bread risen with yeast is fermented? Aged beef most sausages all of the cured ham.  Coffee cacao and most other foodstuff thats put in piles and then dried? Thats fermentation thats arrested at the right time by lowering moisture until its too dry for whatever is fermenting it.  If its too cheesy yeah its probably too fermented. On the other end of the spectrum washed coffee is the least fermented but it still is fermented while the berry residue on the beans dries in whatever number of days it takes.,i4tvcif,/r/Coffee/comments/u465h3/why_does_my_coffee_smell_strongly_of_parmesan/i4vdq3j/'

i4tixxp,2022-04-15 04:32:29,PhantomWD,u44tef,Are hand pourers considerably better than auto drip machines?,The biggest difference is control and the cost.  \- With manual brewing you have full control over temperature water amounts you can perfectly hit the required flow rates etc.  \- They are also much cheaper to get a decent brew. A v60 AeroPress or similar will run you less than $30.  To get anywhere close to a decent cup from a drip machine you are spending at least $150 if not more.

i4tvfo6,2022-04-15 06:28:58,LEJ5512,u44tef,Are hand pourers considerably better than auto drip machines?,IMO... greatly emphasizing the word *opinion*... a pourover with a decent kettle and technique will outperform any auto drip until you either get up to the fancier machines with good water temperature control and/or a trick shower head.  You can also of course [hack a cheap drip machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Ga8SRhRrE) (which is what I do using a bloom and hot water) and with a proper dose and good grounds make coffee thatll impress your friends.  If youre expecting an identical brew to your Aeropress I think youll be disappointed but youll also get different results from each of a Chemex V60 Clever etc etc.  So I wouldnt look for a drip machine as a more-convenient-replacement but instead treat it as an addition to your gear stash.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u44tef/are_hand_pourers_considerably_better_than_auto/i4tvfo6/'

There are some fancy auto drip that will consistently make good cups. While a hand pour over you can have a bit more control.  At the end of the day once you get consistent enough with a pour over and compare it to a expensive auto pour over the difference are about the same (as long as we keep everything the same: paper coffee grind etc).

I loved the way it produced coffee with a slightly fuller body. For some reason I eventually switched to a French press and have used that the last 3-4 years. I’d like to switch it up again though and am wondering which route to go next. Would you suggest Chemex aeropress or something else?,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4x4osg/'
i4to8b3,2022-04-15 05:26:32,CauliflowerPlenty879,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I think Hoffmann has said that stirring the crust after 4 minutes stops the brewing and the grounds just sit at the bottom. I dont know how that works. But either way I think immersion brews in general just get better the longer you leave them,i4tm30l,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4to8b3/'
i4tovs5,2022-04-15 05:32:38,AClockworkPineapple,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,After the first few minutes you remove the crust at the top but most of the grounds have settled to the bottom. I believe removing the crust makes sure it will not get overextracted. I try to do at least one Hoffmann french press with each of my bags because I find some flavors tend to pop more using this method. It could be that there is more flavor it could be that waiting the additional time causes the brew to be cooler so the flavor profile will be different. If you have the time I think it adds just a little bit more punch into the cup.  I prefer the receipe from u/VibrantCoffee for my Hoffmann french press: https://www.vibrantcoffeeroasters.com/pages/french-press-brew-guide,i4tm30l,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4tovs5/'
i4uxqhq,2022-04-15 10:56:07,_Insider,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Depends whether you want to stick with Aeropress or not. If you do then the Timemore C2 is probably good enough. The JX Pro will be more future-proof. It has higher uniformity which you will need the most with filter coffee like the V60. You will also see some improvement with the Aeropress but much less imo its not worth the extra cost for Aeropress alone. It also has finer grind adjustment which is needed to dial in espresso but not at all needed for filter/Aeropress. Finally the build quality is nicer but the Timemore is already good enough.,i4uu73v,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4uxqhq/'
i4vurxj,2022-04-15 14:54:12,SophisticatedApeCC,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,We arent versed in the flavour of the Dunkin Donuts coffee from our research looks like it is a blend of medium roasted central/South American beans grade 2 they will have a unique blend which from reviews we can see has a good mixture of flavours that are common throughout C/SA so I doubt you would find an exact match unless a roastery has blend matched that particular coffee.  It will be very tough to find I would have thought.  We would recommend finding a South American blend that has low acidity but some floral notes and going from there. It may just have to be a trial and error but theres nothing better than trialling a new coffee every now and then!,i4v56jv,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4vurxj/'

i4wdn2o,2022-04-15 17:22:41,VibrantCoffee,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Cup the coffee to see if it is actually fruity before you lose your mind adjusting variables and changing methods/techniques etc.  Can you describe in detail what it tastes like currently? Flat? Underwhelming? Bitter/chocolatey? Astringent (mouth-drying)? Sour? Floral? I know it can be hard to pinpoint exactly what you are tasting but if you cant then we cant really tell you to grind finer or coarser or make any other adjustment. Which is why cupping with a pretty fine grind is a great place to start.,i4vuzv8,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4wdn2o/'
i4vwdew,2022-04-15 15:06:21,SophisticatedApeCC,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,How fine are you grinding your beans currently? If you havent gone all the way to a medium fine brewing for a single cup usually requires a slightly finer grind. So try take it a little further than you currently are. Not sure what you have tried so far but simple things like making sure water isnt too hot you can lose the ability to taste the more floral notes at the higher temps. Usual recipe of 1:15 and blooming with about 10% of that water for 30 seconds then slowly pour for another 1 min 30-1m45 and should finish 45 second or so afterwards.,i4vuzv8,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4vwdew/'
i4twm6i,2022-04-15 06:38:30,QiHanZhao,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I would use also coarser grind for a wave. The flow restriction of the wave will naturally increase contact time.,i4tsfan,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4twm6i/'
i4tybi2,2022-04-15 06:51:56,bostoncreampuff,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,The wave is known for clogging issues (generally true for most flat bottom brewers). You can try putting a metal mesh on the bottom. Coarser is probably better for a faster flow rate however I have always thought that flat bottom brewers are sort of the midpoint between cone brewers and a pure immersion brew. So I dont grind to match brew time of a v60 I just grind abit coarser and let it brew. I would not do the stir or the Hoffman swirl though this would add to the clogging issue.  Look into April coffees youtube channel they have alot of great content for flat bottom brewers.  Personally I like thier split between the circle pour and center pour and had good results from that.,i4tsfan,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4tybi2/'
i4uc5zb,2022-04-15 08:31:09,wipny,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I think most of the recipes I’ve seen generally recommend grinding slightly coarser for the Wave.   I have a Blue Bottle dripper and enjoy using it. It’s like a single hole porcelain Kalita Wave 185 and takes the same filters.   It’s easy to use and pretty foolproof. I’ve made consistently tasty cups. It stalls slightly with natural Ethiopian coffees due to fines but I think that’s an issue with any dripper.,i4tsfan,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4uc5zb/'

They are super shady and not to be trusted at all.  That said for a light roast coffee Id use something around 12 clicks for French Press. If this is actually light-medium Id maybe bump up to around 15 or so. 25 is almost guaranteed to give you watery sour underwhelming coffee.,i4w8fzo,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4wdc7q/'
i4wp47c,2022-04-15 18:56:08,rumuraisin,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,The easiest step would probably be buying kcups from a specialty roaster although pods themselves are meh for other reasons. Next easiest would be locally roasted coffee ground at the cafe or roaster and using a reusable kcup with a paper filter. Then would be getting a grinder and grinding fresh before brewing. Then would be something like a French press or aeropress then working your way through different brewing methods.   Kinda depends on what your morning routine looks like and how much the convenience of a pod is important to you.  Edit: also using good water either something like BWT filter for coffee or remineralizing with third wave or perfect coffee water keeping the keurig clean with regular descaling and cleaning around brew chamber.,i4womqc,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4wp47c/'

In all likelihood I’ll probably be using the aeropress as my primary brewer. French press when I have extra time. Probably try some percolation brews after I get a good gooseneck kettle. From your comment it seems the jx pro will be the better product for me and working with the blade grinder for a bit. Just to confirm the grinder is the best thing to upgrade at this point?

i4v5465,2022-04-15 11:46:35,_Insider,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,   >  the grinder is the best thing to upgrade at this point  Yes. Both options are much better than the blade grinder. But immersion brews are much more forgiving so you can get away with a cheaper option. Also if you dont want to make espresso with it you could get the non-pro JX for a bit less. Same burr but with larger steps.   > Are there other things I should look to purchase  Some sort of scale to brew on is very helpful ideally with .1g accuracy but any cheap one will do. Fancier coffee scales (with a timer or even app) are nice to have but not necessary. For the kettle I would look into temperature control lower temps can help a lot with darker roasts in the Aeropress. Again not strictly necessary but will help you get the most out of your Aeropress. And as you said a goose neck helps a lot with pour overs if you want to explore that.   Some other nice-to-have accessories for the Aeropress are the Fellow Prismo and some sort of server to brew into I like glass or metal (more stable just use a larger milk jug).,i4v1yog,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4v5465/'

i4wflzr,2022-04-15 17:38:40,VibrantCoffee,u44msu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,The weekly bean recommendation thread on this sub is one of the only non-biased places youll find.  Coffee review websites/apps/etc are tough because coffee quality is so user dependent (if you have a crappy grinder then a coffee Id give an 88 you might give a 70). Id also argue that there is less general awareness of a light roast flavor profile versus a dark roast flavor profile than there is with a lager versus an IPA for example. So beer reviews are easier because you get fewer IPA-loving lager-hating people that buy a lager because they dont really know what it is and then hate it and give it a bad review. And for some reason these kinds of websites in coffee are particularly prone to bias and they do things like only give good reviews to companies that advertise with them or the owners of the review website secretly own a roasting company which of course then gets all the best reviews.,i4weic8,/r/Coffee/comments/u44msu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4wflzr/'

i4vg9mu,2022-04-15 13:05:55,Makaijin,u42wgk,Good Grinders vs Average Grinders,The C40 doesn/t have a visual indicator to tell you your current grind setting. If you forget your current click amount you have to set it back to 0 and recount the number of clicks.  The Kplus/Kmax have big number markings where you can see and instantly set to your required grind setting. So if you your other recipe was like 6.5 or something you can just look at the big number and set it to 6.5 there right away. Way less hassle than the C40 having to reset and recount the clicks.,i4v9zop,/r/Coffee/comments/u42wgk/good_grinders_vs_average_grinders/i4vg9mu/'
i4wihsp,2022-04-15 18:01:55,Polymer714,u42wgk,Good Grinders vs Average Grinders,The advantage of the C40 is you can trade recipes based on clicks...  But the problem w/ the C40 is you only have the clicks to tell you where youre at.  So if you like to tinker which means youre changing your grind settings fairly regularly then how many clicks are you at at any given time?  You need to remember or write it down..there isnt any indicator on where youre at and to me that is the main flaw of the C40...great grinder though but the thought of going back to zero and then counting clicks each time..thats pretty meh...  And the thing with using someone elses recipe is one water youre using isnt the same..the technique might not be the same even the preferences in what you want out of coffee wont be the same so does it matter?  There are so many people obsessed with doing exactly what someone else is doing but why?  Their opinion about how that recipe turns out (assuming you even got the same result) is just that their opinion.  What is more important is what YOU think of the coffee and making changes to your preferences..,i4v9zop,/r/Coffee/comments/u42wgk/good_grinders_vs_average_grinders/i4wihsp/'

i4sdyuf,2022-04-14 20:14:11,uuutangnamegenerator,u3y08f,Which is the best brewing method to compare different grinders and why?,There are different theories of how to test a grinder and to determine what differences there are. Really what your goals are matters most. I personally brew two cups side by side in the method that Id normally brew trying to make them as similar as possible.   Another method might be to push the grinders as fine as they can before they choke/get bitter and then to see which one performs better at its best dialed in setting.   And then theres the real possibility youre not pushing the grinders fine enough/ hot enough/ cupping in a way that will bring out those differences. Or that the beans youre using to cup arent ideal in showing those differences. There are tons of variables you can consider.    Personally my test for new gear is to use it for a few days to a week so I can dial it in get used to it and then compare it head to head in my normal workflow with the gear I had been using before. By then I should have a decent handle on the new gear and if I didnt change my settings on the old gear - have a best vs best comparison.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3y08f/which_is_the_best_brewing_method_to_compare/i4sdyuf/'
i4tq57c,2022-04-15 05:44:00,VibrantCoffee,u3y08f,Which is the best brewing method to compare different grinders and why?,As others have said Id generally just say compare them using the brew method that you actually want to use them for. If you only brew French Press theres no reason to compare via V60.  Hypothetically if you brewed via every method (except espresso) and wanted to compare overall Id go with an auto drip machine to eliminate the variability of hand pouring and not have the results skewed by the relative forgiveness of immersion brewing.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3y08f/which_is_the_best_brewing_method_to_compare/i4tq57c/'
i4siie9,2022-04-14 20:54:21,mastley3,u3y08f,Which is the best brewing method to compare different grinders and why?,I think you may be asking the wrong question. God thats pretentious. Anyway comparing two grinders only holds for that method and I think its only fair to try to dial in each grinder for the method and see which one is easier or more suited to the method.  For example V60 is technique-heavy but it is also biased toward grinders that dont produce a huge volume of fines and also toward grinders with good uniformity.  Immersion methods are more forgiving in both these respects and espresso is less forgiving as well as requiring fine adjustments in the fine-grind range.  An immersion method may make it difficult to discern small differences. V60 may highlight differences but either of these could be confounded by poor technique.  Your experiment showed that to your taste those grinders were similar for that bean and that technique you used. Thats it.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3y08f/which_is_the_best_brewing_method_to_compare/i4siie9/'
i4t349x,2022-04-15 01:00:13,rubber_duck01,u3y08f,Which is the best brewing method to compare different grinders and why?,Comparing the grinders hardware is important. Ceramic burrs cool faster than a titanium burr so you don’t need to adjust as often throughout service. Personally I’d say that shape is also really important. Are you looking for conical burr or a flat burr?   Conical grinders tend to grind and smash the bean so when performing a V60 extraction like @mastley3 mentioned you will get more fines from the “smashing” instead of “grinding”. This can result in a muddy bed of coffee at the end of extraction and you’ll find the rate of extraction slows with your last pulse of water. You’ll more often than not get more bitterness through this type of extraction purely because of the conical burr. For espresso this isn’t so bad and any adjustment you make has to be made while the grinder is activated. You get reasonable control with this shape also.   Flat burr grinders can be more expensive because they don’t smash the beans as much so you get more uniform size grind. This gives you much more flexible control over your extraction rate which is easier to experiment with sweetness or acidity… depending on what flavour you are looking to extract and/or highlight.  All that to say I find V60 extraction method is a good way to test your grinders ability to control and regulate grind size.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3y08f/which_is_the_best_brewing_method_to_compare/i4t349x/'

i4v7a8p,2022-04-15 12:01:44,VibrantCoffee,u3y08f,Which is the best brewing method to compare different grinders and why?,Yes cupping is immersion brewing. It is the fastest/easiest/most consistent way to evaluate green coffees and roast profiles partially because it is so forgiving. You basically get a good quality reasonably high extraction no matter what you do unless you grind way too coarse.

I think a nespresso vertuo is probably the closest thing to being as convenient as a keurig but producing better coffee. You might be able to make the environmental case that keurig pods are terrible for the environment while nespresso pods are at least “recyclable” on paper. If you really want better coffee for yourself it sounds like that may end up being an addition on top of the keurig rather than a replacement. Folks suggesting any form of manual coffee maker even something as easy as french press or aeropress are missing the point that anything that requires grinding beans and pouring water to get coffee is still exponentially more inconvenient than using a keurig.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4r9g4h/'

It is under $500 and while it is not as easy as the Keurig it makes amazing coffee because we can buy the beans and grind them when we need them. And while we dont use the feature you are able to pre-set a time for the coffee to grind and brew so it is ready for when your hubby crawls out of bed. And again it has lasted us since 2016.

i4tuysk,2022-04-15 06:25:06,NotYourScratchMonkey,u3qam6,How do I convince my SO to give up the Keurig?,So I used to use a Keurig and yes it was super convenient if you wanted one cup.  But I like to drink a lot of coffee in the AM so it wasnt the best solution.  In addition the pods are wasteful and I never got great results with that mesh filter you could use with your own coffee.  So now I have an OXO grinder and a 9-cup OXO maker.  Here is the effort I put into coffee:  * Grind some beans (they are already in the grinder hopper and I just push a button.  Plus you can skip this step if you buy pre-ground coffee) * Put the grinds and a filter  in the coffee maker  * Fill the vessel up with water * Push a button  Then in about 10 minutes I have a full carafe of coffee that lasts me all morning that is as strong or as weak as I want it to be since I control the coffee to water ratio.  Its not that much more effort and you can eliminate some of the steps by buying pre-ground coffee.  And while that first cup is certainly more effort than using a Keurig is *the second third and fourth cups are much easier.*,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4tuysk/'

Fill the water tank and grounds the night before and bam dont have to worry about anything else just hit the botton. There are decent makers that can be programmed to run automatically.  Also as a coffee enjoyer you can dial in the flavor you like. I get different flavor grounds from coffee over cardio. And with any ground you can add or lessen the amount of coffee to water ratio that can wildly change the way coffee tastes. Kcups you cant really. This is a great channel for coffee adivce.

Has a grinder but theres more steps involved than above * Breville Grind Control -- coffee maker. Grinds and brews all in one step. Downside is its designed to make a whole pot and less of a single cup maker (where the two above make singles) * For all these youd add any milk/flavorings after its brewed. Easy peasy though. You just get syrups like Monin.  Ive never owned any of the above. Ive used the BBE extensively.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4qwhyd/'

i4r5j71,2022-04-14 14:32:56,Skygrasper25,u3qam6,How do I convince my SO to give up the Keurig?,Former Starbucks coffee master. I have a Nespresso machine. Was pretty cheap too all things considered. Works for me because a cup of coffee isnt strong enough for me. Nespresso has a wide range of really great espresso varieties. I was genuinely surprised because Im a major coffee snob. Espressos can be turned into Americanos very easily if he wants a more plain cup of (really good) coffee.   However if what youre asking is a machine that will fit other family needs like making hot chocolate and pouring hot water for tea then Keurig or another pod machine might be a better way to go indeed as there are hot chocolate and milk pods. Keurig has cheaper options for multi-purpose machines than Nespresso does.   Also side note I dont know if this would apply to you but a lot of people who get an upset stomach from coffee get it because the coffee is too acidic. There lots of low acidity coffees out there that you can get from both local and chain shops. You can get the beans ground up for reusable pods. Visiting local shops and getting more varietal coffees might also be a good way to elevate your hubbys coffee experience without breaking the bank.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4r5j71/'

Its easy to use very easy to clean nearly indestructible and cheap for a coffee maker. Ive made 2-3 cups a day with it for the last two years after converting from V60 and Ill never go back. If you want to make more than one cup you can use it to make a concentrated Brew then stretch it out with more water.  You will need a kettle if you dont already have one. But a kettle and an aeropress will run you up significantly less than 500 You could probably just boil water on the stove but thats a pain in the ass.  If you want to really elevate your shit use the remaining money on a good grinder. Im saving for a Baratza Encore at the moment.  Ive worked in specialty coffee for most of my working life thats what I use at home and its what I recommend to my customers who want to start brewing at home.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4r5s5j/'

i4rowbl,2022-04-14 16:54:54,Snichs72,u3qam6,How do I convince my SO to give up the Keurig?,A decent grinder plus a simple paper-filter pour over. For someone who prioritizes convenience and ease of use that’s about as simple of a workflow as I can think of. If you can get a pour over that’s dishwasher safe it’s a bonus. Just grind beans wet paper dump in grounds pour over toss filter and grounds into trash. Just a quick rinse of the pour over plus the periodic wash in the dishwasher makes for easy cleaning. Yes it’s marginally more work than a Keurig but once you get into a groove the process can be very quick and easy. Maybe you use it yourself a bit so they can see how easy it easy and how good of coffee it makes. French press is a hassle to clean. Moka pot can be a hassle to learn to do well and is a hassle to clean.

Check out the Breville Precision Brewer - thermal carafe. For the grinder opt for the matching Smart Grinder Pro. It’s an unobtrusive design that will blend in with most kitchens and countertops. You’ll get good quality within price range with comparable convenience. Also get a scale and you’re set.   I think chemex pour over or aeropress are out of the question for a pedestrian who wants convenience and essentially minimal effort.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4tevy9/'

i4tv6nb,2022-04-15 06:26:54,HardwareLust,u3qam6,How do I convince my SO to give up the Keurig?,IMHO the best one-cup non-Keurig solution is the Technivorm Cup-One machine. Ive literally tried all the pod machines and this is what I settled on.  The waste is far less (One #1 paper filter per cup) and you have a literally infinite variety of coffee to choose from.  While it does require a tiny bit more effort as long as your coffee maker is near your water and your trash its pretty simple to operate.  If youre especially short on time or motivation you can just buy pre-ground coffee for him and maybe someday insert a grinder into the equation to maximize output quality at some point in the future.  And its well within your budget ($245 US).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4tv6nb/'

If you have to maybe try to do it in smaller steps? I dont actually know Keurig we dont have it here afaik its a capsule system like Nespresso right? So there should be third party capsules you can re-use and fill yourself.A grinder would be a start but afaik every grinder that can do espresso level grinding costs at least 400 bucks. Maybe get a decent hand-grinder that can do espresso-grind and fill those capsules yourself.  I have no idea how freshly ground coffee works in a Keurig in those capsules but if its good maybe you can convince him that way and hell be more open to other options?  If it doesnt have to be espresso something like the Wilfa Svart grinder is very convenient imho and not too expensive get a V60 you can do great filter coffee rather easily.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4u5s8f/'

The coffee is immensely higher quality than a Keurig it can do both espressos and regular coffee is moderately priced at $200-250 you can order dozens of different flavors and types of espressos and coffees from Nespresso the pods are recyclable and they can send a bag in with your order to put your used pods and ship back with UPS and the company is part owned by George Clooney.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4u6kiw/'

Get several of the baskets so if one is in the washer there are a couple available. Not really difficult to do just weigh beans grind put basket in and push button. Dont buy pods because of the Envirernmental issues and just bad coffee.

i4uus6b,2022-04-15 10:36:13,Mishtayan,u3qam6,How do I convince my SO to give up the Keurig?,A toddy cold brew system makes a coffee concentrate. You have to let it brew on the counter 24 hours but then you have about 7 cups of concentrated coffee which makes between 25 & 30 cups of coffee. And it is really good coffee!  It takes me maybe 5 or 6  minutes to set the toddy up add the coffee & water & set it aside. When its done you just pull the plug & let the coffee drain into the carafe maybe 10 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup of concentrate to your mug top with boiling water (or add water & microwave). I mean it is ridiculously simple & fast to make a cup of coffee after the initial brew. Like 2 minutes.  That 24 hour brewing process comes out to between 25 to 30 cups of coffee. Its low acid so it wont upset your stomach. You can experiment around with portions & both have the strength if coffee you prefer.   If you get the mesh brewing bags clean up is a breeze. Ive been using the same mesh bag for at least one batch a week for 6 months you just need to wash it out right away and hang it over night to dry.

Bloomfield Koffee King model 8543 is what I have had for 20-ish yrs.  A Bunn  machine would also be great. My Koffee King is bullet proof and fast. You dont need a full featured unit just one or two heating elements.  Last time I looked they were around $450-ish. They take a larger filter  than normal that I buy from the restaurant supply store by the box.  A box lasts me more than a year maybe more than two at about one per day.  Great coffee fast. What every coffee fiend needs. especially in the morning. Mine claims less than 5 mins to brew but it is more like 2-3 mins. I wouldnt use anything else. If you have it for a couple of decades and internal hoses break down the machine is easily rebuildable. Parts can be ordered through the Restaurant supply store.

Technology>people - have to partly unwind lid to get it to pour     - after repeated unwinds when you lose track the lid ends up in your coffee cup. About 3x/year for me - small drips often end up on the counter (the rim has no lip) - has 2 settings for opening size but the smaller one clogs up (might have to adjust grind) - to carry the basket towards the waste you usually have to close the opening so it doesnt drip on the floor. Which is fine except if you forget to re-open it before the next use…in which case: - machine will allow you to brew with the basket closed resulting in a huge freaking mess including grinds in your coffee and depending on how much you make and when you notice you screwed up can drip all over the counter. Another 2-3x per year.   Moccamaster - the brewer i hate to love or love to hate or something.,i4rzl8f,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4s560j/'

I always start my morning with a cup of coffee from my Moccamaster because its simple to use produces great coffee and is quick to clean up. Its best to grind fresh beans with a decent burr grinder (Baratza Encore?) along with a scale that measures to 1/10 gram. As others have said use beans that arent too different in flavor from what your SO currently uses.  There are other SCA approved coffee makers that cost less. I havent used them so cant comment about them but they should also make excellent coffee.

Instead buy preground or whole bean coffee from my local shops and then have a reusable keurig pod which you can buy at a local grocer or online. One reusable pod lasts me about 2 or more years depending on how many cups he is making a day and I have not replaced my Keurig in 7 years.

If he wants to keep using a keurig but with the re-usable cup + the freshly ground beans thats the biggest win possible already.   Optional step 2: Sneakily buy an aeropress french press moka pot v60 chemex cold brew or whatever manual coffee method YOU want for YOURSELF. Use it for yourself when YOU want coffee dont offer it to him when youre not making it for yourself. However when you do make coffee always offer to make some for him as well. When he eventually asks you out of the blue to make him coffee with your special method or when you catch him trying to make some for himself using your manual coffee maker you will have won. The secret is to make him choose your method over his without trying to push him a certain way with words. Let the experience speak for itself. If it doesnt then no amount of convincing wouldve worked anyways and at least youll both be able to make coffee with your favorite method and since you will be using fresh locally roasted beans it will be way more environmentally friendly than keurig/nespresso AND taste better.,i4qw9fx,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4rqp4n/'

But if it is environmental then I haven’t seen anyone else suggest this.  Would he want a Senseo machine? It’s a “soft pod” (picture a round tea bag.) Much more popular in Europe.   We tried it for the first time at an Airbnb in France. But when my super automatic broke after 14 years we decide to get a Senseo (until I decide if I want another super automatic or get a more manual set up.)You can compost the pods! Off of Amazon the pods are about $0.40/coffee. You don’t have as many options though if he likes all those fancy coffees. We’re in BC but ordered the machine off of a website that is based in Ontario this it was about $300.

But Keurig did not displace to-go coffee.  They displaced other forms of coffee making in homes and offices--drip machines in particular--that previously didnt produce large quantities of disposable consumer plastic.  Furthermore because Keurig pods are a combination of plastic with aluminum unlike to-go plastic coffee cup lids theyre very difficult to recycle.  So yes Keurigs have meaningfully and avoidably worsened our plastic pollution problem.,i4rmr7k,/r/Coffee/comments/u3qam6/how_do_i_convince_my_so_to_give_up_the_keurig/i4rnyp9/'

Buy the 03 since you get more space for larger brews and your small brews will be the same (the cone at the bottom is the same size).,i4r5lo0,/r/Coffee/comments/u3luci/i_got_hold_of_a_vst_refractometer_and_did_a_deep/i4rimrh/'
i4t1qsl,2022-04-15 00:41:06,I_AM_THE_REAL_GOD,u3luci,I got hold of a VST refractometer and did a deep analysis of Hario Switch recipes,Personally I find if I close the brewer and pour a bloom it releases the CO2 and during the next pour to 250ml there are less floating grinds. If I dont do a bloom there is a ring of grinds floating on bubbles. Not sure if it affects anything,i4t1hpm,/r/Coffee/comments/u3luci/i_got_hold_of_a_vst_refractometer_and_did_a_deep/i4t1qsl/'

You press either the 2-4 cups button or the 5-8 cups button to brew. I just dont know what the difference is between the buttons. They both brew all the water in the tank.

If you have a scale you should weigh the coffee and water you are using. 16:1 is a fairly standard ratio with 17:1 being weaker and 15:1 being stronger.

Longer bloom - try blooming for anywhere up to two minutes. 2. Agrressively prewarm your v60 if you are using ceramic. 3. Wait until the first pour drains before you do the second pour. 4. Try using a stick to stir instead of the last swirl 5. Try a different bean - some beans are just naturally more sour. 6. Consider a flat bottom brewer like kalita or April.

That doesn’t mean you’ve got too many fines per se (some beans specially denser high altitude ones produce more fines by default) but could also be due to too much agitation.

i4owq4v,2022-04-14 05:21:34,coffeetourpodcast,u3eevw,Newbie at trying coffee,So there are a bunch of different avenues to beginning but don’t let anyone convince you that you need to spend a bunch of money or purchase an espresso machine off the bat.  The three avenues I’d recommend are: 1. Drip coffee maker. This is the easiest method for a beginner but you aren’t able to tinker around with it as easily as some other methods. Chose this if you want to start drinking coffee but not if you’re interested in becoming a coffee fanatic. ($15 at Walmart) 2. Cold Brew maker. This is a nice easy way to make cold brew. You can tinker with the steeping time the coffee to water ratio and other characteristics of the coffee. ($15 on Amazon) 3. V60 Pour Over. This is a method that may appear overwhelming at first glance but it’s actually not very hard to make a coffee. This allows for a HUGE array of ways to tinker with your coffee and make it taste ‘perfect’ for you. ($20 on Amazon)  Now if you want quality coffee you need to purchase quality beans. I’d recommend starting with a local coffee shop and buying beans they recommend. You can tell them what you enjoy or that you’re a beginner and they can point you in the right direction. They can also grind the beans for you in-shop so there is not a need to purchase a grinder at first. Once you fall deeper into the hobby you will acquire more equipment (like a grinder and machines for multiple methods of brewing) but don’t think you need to start with them.  James Hoffman has some good content on being a beginner and I have a podcast with a couple episodes that may be helpful: [At Home Coffee Recommendations](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1w0h1AyJtmFPM8BRxwW52A?si=k_4Gg_SkT6avJk1Q2mv2Zw)  Hit me up if you have any more questions!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3eevw/newbie_at_trying_coffee/i4owq4v/'
i4oz9op,2022-04-14 05:43:40,TxAgBen,u3eevw,Newbie at trying coffee,Ive tried several methods and my favorite for the ease cleanup and just a quality cup of coffee is the Clever Dripper. I also bought me a quality burr grinder but if you arent ready to spend that kind of money Id suggest getting your supplier to grind your beans. Beans and water are critical. I use a filter system for my coffee water because our tap doesnt taste all that great. I also get good quality and freshly roasted beans delivered or you may have a local store/supplier. Enjoy the ride Ive been drinking coffee for nearly 20 years and Im still learning new things about it every day!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3eevw/newbie_at_trying_coffee/i4oz9op/'

i4p12rb,2022-04-14 05:58:49,TxAgBen,u3eevw,Newbie at trying coffee,So I wasnt trying to be overwhelming but I kind of nerded out on you. So heres the simplest set-up that Id recommend:     1) Brewer (Id suggest a Clever Dripper or Aeropress but there are lots of options that you can try out as you see fit. These are typically fairly inexpensive so I have several that I play with).  2) Water Filter (Not strictly necessary but even just a Brita pitcher is usually a good idea. Remember that coffee almost entirely water.)  3) Kettle (Ive got a cheap gooseneck that I bought on Amazon but neither the Clever nor the Aeropress require a gooseneck so a tea kettle works if you have one)  4) Scale (Again not strictly necessary but helps keep your brews very consistent. I bought a fairly cheap scale on Amazon that had a built-in timer)  5) Beans (Find a reputable local seller or online distributor who will get you freshly roasted beans mine typically arrive within 2-5 days of roasting)  6) Grinder (Completely optional. If you do buy one Id recommend getting a good quality burr grinder. If you search this sub you will find a ton of good advice on grinders)     TLDR   Get a kettle a simple brew device and some good beans.,i4ozn4a,/r/Coffee/comments/u3eevw/newbie_at_trying_coffee/i4p12rb/'

i4p23ul,2022-04-14 06:07:01,TxAgBen,u3eevw,Newbie at trying coffee,Ah gotcha havent had my coffee yet!      I saw in your other comment that you like cold-brew. There are some cheap metal tubes that fit perfectly in a Mason jar on ebay that are awesome for cold brew. Ive gotten to where I prefer iced coffee over cold brew personally. So Ill make a concentrated mixture in my Aeropress and press it directly onto ice. It gives me the nice aromatics of a hot brew but is nice and cold for those hot summer days.,i4p1edk,/r/Coffee/comments/u3eevw/newbie_at_trying_coffee/i4p23ul/'

i4on067,2022-04-14 03:40:32,AClockworkPineapple,u3duk5,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I totally messed up a cold brew recipe.   I usually dont start cold brew so early in the year but its been warm and I have some beans from Anodyne that I dont particularly care for. So last week I made about 800ml of cold brew concentrate from recipe by u/Extremofire. I did a 1:8 ratio for 96 hours in the fridge and cut it 1:1 with water. It was decent this was my first attempt at cold brew with a lighter roast. This week however I forgot to adjust the grind settings on my crappy $50 electric grinder and accidentally ground the finest espresso. I figured whatever itll be a neat experiment.  Same recipe otherwise and as u/Extremofire mentioned the flavor is quite a bit deeper definitely not off putting as I thought it might be. It is quite smooth and the flavor tones are more prominent this time around. Not boozy as he mentioned but on its way there.  I guess I need to fuck around and find out more often experimentation is fun!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3duk5/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4on067/'

i4p08d5,2022-04-14 05:51:50,poleywog,u3duk5,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Speedy brew methods? Beginning to go back into the office and my current morning routine is a bit lengthy as a result of brewing pour over. Takes 10-15 minutes and I can’t really walk away from it.   French press is simpler but I prefer a cleaner cup without the silt. I’m thinking about possibly getting a Clever immersion brewer but have concerns about the capacity. Can’t quite afford the $300 automatic brewers.   So any brewing methods I may not be aware of? I generally brew about 600ml of coffee at a 1:20 ratio but once or twice a week brew up to 800-900ml. It seems like I’d be maxing out the clever brewer with my typical 600ml brews.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3duk5/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4p08d5/'

A couple hands-off approaches would be a regular drip machine or a moka pot.  I dont use my pourover very often anymore for the same reason it bugs you (have to tend to it and cant walk away).  My moka pot though I can load it up put it on the stovetop and then prep the rest of my breakfast while it brews.  My 3-cup Bialetti pot takes about 18g and extracts quite a lot so do the math from there.

i4qygb7,2022-04-14 13:44:35,treeneedles,u3drvi,Just started brewing coffee using an Aeropress and its just.. not nice?,Honestly people overcomplicate this device that was *intentionally made to be as simple as possible.* I find it really frustrating to see these barista types making complex acrobatic processes for the Aeropress. Even the inverted method can be unnecessarily complicated but I do use it with nicer cofees to allow for better extraction.  Some of the best Aeropress ive ever made has been with Cafe Bustello brewed with the Original method - one heaping scoop  i fill it to the 2 beacause the 1 isnt enough water stir and then use the plunger slowly. Delicious coffee with no fuss and bullshit secondary brew times three different points at which to stir or add more water measuring to the half-gram or milliliter weird pointless tampings or silly pour techniques. When I stopped trying these crazy complicating methods I found that the coffee i made was really damned good.. These methods can be great for pour overs and french presses and expensive machines but its wasted effort on the simple AP. It all just needs to get hot wet and stirred. Thats it!   The aeropress is meant to be simple and fast. Use it as designed. No you arent going to make espresso but it will be very good.

i4omi7c,2022-04-14 03:34:24,losttexanian,u3drvi,Just started brewing coffee using an Aeropress and its just.. not nice?,Aeropress is a fickle thing. It can be very time consuming to properly highlight the flavors in a coffee that you like and then if you change coffees the process can change very drastically again. I personally watched a ton of videos and tested out a ton of coffee before I found a catch all method that usually gives me drinkable coffee. I dont have an exact amount of coffee to water somewhere between 12:1 and 15:1 then I slowly pour in my water and let that infuse for a little bit and then Ill stir for about 30 seconds maybe 45 depending on my mood and the coffee. This works for me because I usually go for chocolate and molasses flavored coffees with brighter coffees I havent fallen in love and I dont know if its because this method doesnt work or if I really dont enjoy more fruity and bright coffees.

i4pm6pz,2022-04-14 08:27:59,MisterKyo,u3drvi,Just started brewing coffee using an Aeropress and its just.. not nice?,In your own words what seems to be missing and/or isnt pleasant about the cappuccino? And how does it taste black? Is it too weak as in diluted? Too little coffee taste? Texturally off? Etc. Knowing your expectations would help guide advice.  Classifying things as too sour/bitter tend towards discussions about extraction but in your case I suspect extraction isnt the issue. I think the issue might be from using the aeropress as an espresso substitute and expecting similarities. Simply put an aeropress will never give you something close to an espresso due to the texture and concentration of an espresso. This is especially true for taking them as shots or in milk drinks because the intensity and textural qualities simply arent there. Even if you put in texturized milk the resulting drink will feel much more diluted if you keep the same ratios as regular espresso-milk drink recipes. Where those pseudo-espresso Aeropress recipes shine is when compared to an americano or long black because the recipe tries to mimic the same flavour intensity.  If you still want to try Id suggest dropping your milk amounts in significantly and aerate your milk much more. Use a thicker milk like oat milk if you want to try it out at the cost of introducing a less neutral taste. This will help you texturize the drink for a fuller mouth feel. As for the coffee perhaps go for something darker roasted to really cut through the milk. Itll be challenging getting something that doesnt resemble brewed coffee + milk and you may have *a bit* more luck with a moka pot.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3drvi/just_started_brewing_coffee_using_an_aeropress/i4pm6pz/'

i4olr8y,2022-04-14 03:24:59,magus-21,u3drvi,Just started brewing coffee using an Aeropress and its just.. not nice?,150g of water with 18 g of coffee should yield about a 4oz/120ml cup which is pretty standard. How much milk are you adding and are you tasting it black first?  The steps I take to decide my numbers:  1) How much caffeine I want determines coffee quantity in grams 2) Quantity of coffee determines quantity of water because I want to stick to a ratio of 1 part coffee to about 8 or 9 parts water for the Aeropress 3) Water temperature depends on roast. Light roasts should use a higher temperature. You can probably guesstimate by counting seconds off a boil. 4) Fine tune with grind size. I err on the finer side rather than the coarser side because I don’t mind a bit of bitterness  Steep time should remain constant. I choose 3 min just because that’s one of the default timers on my Apple Watch lol.  It could also be that you just don’t like the coffee beans you’re using.,i4okhnx,/r/Coffee/comments/u3drvi/just_started_brewing_coffee_using_an_aeropress/i4olr8y/'

i4pg63j,2022-04-14 07:48:29,LEJ5512,u3drvi,Just started brewing coffee using an Aeropress and its just.. not nice?,I think what youre finding out is the Aeropress has a lot of flexibility which also leaves room for bad brews.  (as in for every championship-winning recipe theres probably a dozen nasty recipes)  But this also means that you have the opportunity to keep tweaking until you find exactly what you like best.

i4pqgdi,2022-04-14 08:55:36,tendorphin,u3drvi,Just started brewing coffee using an Aeropress and its just.. not nice?,The taste is pretty different. You can achieve some crossover between the brews but youd need to brew purposely for a very light cup on the aeropress and a very strong cup with pour over to find that crossover. With the aeropress youre getting some immersion brewing plus pressure and with pour over youre getting well pour over. Pressure brings out the deeper bolder more bitter flavors right off the bat so its already got that added into each cup whereas a pour over has to use an extra fine grind or slow filter to just start to get more of those flavors.   As others are saying keep experimenting. The most important thing with coffee is that all the rules are really just guidelines and all that ultimately matters is if you like whats in the cup at the end. Everything else is irrelevant.,i4ol4xp,/r/Coffee/comments/u3drvi/just_started_brewing_coffee_using_an_aeropress/i4pqgdi/'

Im located in Australia and can get the GCP + BSGP for $900 and the BBE for $650. As a first time home espresso buyer will I notice notice difference enough to justify the additional cost?,You can upgrade the components individually and there is a huge modding community for the Gaggia.   Over a year ago I asked myself the same question. The answer for me personally was no. It is true that if your espresso machine is halfway decent and the Gaggia is the grinder can be upgraded quite well and youll have a difference. But at which point to start and where to stop? For me it was just a convenience and design thing to go for the Sage/Breville Barista Pro. First of all I wanted something without a boiler so I dont have to wait a couple of minutes till I can pull a shot and I dont like wasting energy by heating up a lot more water than I need for one single shot.   The Breville one gets some hate because its not modular and it isnt high end. Theres a limit with that grinder at one point and thats fair. But it works and the baseline is that it can achieve decent espresso. The Smart Grinder Pro (basically the same grinder as in the Barista Pro but higher increments in Grindtime sadly) is a good entry level grinder and almost unbeatable at its price point. If you dont feel the need to go all out then go for it. Just be warned there might be a limit you might hit at one point but that can be said for almost everything I suppose. The Gaggia itself might be less limiting than the Barista Pro but not sure by how much. Wasnt able to compare them side by side yet.  Besides the modularity youll also have not as big of a modding community. Its easy to get replacement parts for basically everything or upgrade a few things here and there for the Gaggia and that gets more difficult with Breville. You can get replacements and if you are comfortable working inside such machines youll probably be able to fix it if something goes wrong but you have less guidance than with the Gaggia.   In my opinion the higher price tag can be justified yes. But its not justified for me because Im seeking a good looking machine that does what I tell it to do without much hassle and preferably with a small footprint. I dont want to wait long so I can pull maybe a slightly better shot and I would want to use the machine until it dies and maybe fix it then. If I would want to upgrade I would want to upgrade grinder and machine anyway at one point. But that is me. You may have a completely different view on longevity and upgradeability and value those things more.  EDIT: from a usability perspective I would always choose to go with the Pro models. They dont necessarily make better coffee but itll save you a lot of nerves when you have a nice display.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u3bdpb/is_the_gaggia_classic_probreville_smart_grinder/i4p3pjz/'

i4shkg6,2022-04-14 20:45:50,loodog555,u316a7,I think I got my Moka Pot Down!,A Baratza Encore is everything you will ever need for a moka pot.   As for how to do it right there are actually a few papers out that look at the physics of it but heres a copy+pasta of my prior advice Ive weaned from reading them and my experience.  We just need to sticky the moka pot post as someone asks a couple times a week about Moka pot tips.  We reinvent the wheel every time.  There are 4 physics of Moka pot papers you can read that inform the Moka practice and you get to this:  The best advice is use an AeroPress filter and remove the pot and apply cold water as soon as it starts bubbling (as you state). Also using preheated water in the tank helps with extraction temperatures.  You can get decent cup of coffee but lets not fool ourselves: its not espresso.  In addition there is an inevitable wide range of temperatures that the pot brews at which is not desirable.   Some academic papers back this up:  1.

i4wjak9,2022-04-15 18:08:31,ComposerFried,u316a7,I think I got my Moka Pot Down!,Coarser grind results in a harsher and muddier brew IMO. Finer grind either dissolves and/pr acts a kind of filter for the coffee. I only use darker roasts with the moka pot - medium roasts are just like battery acid from this thing. You can also tap the basket a bit to even things out and let the finer grounds settle. You can also make a little wisk with a cork and some needles to get rid of any clumps and get a more even flow.  Also make sure you arent drinking any aluminium dust which can form if you scrub the pot too aggressively.  I dilute the end product with water for an Americano. Always tastes good/same and I use a blade grinder lol. Thats the only way I make coffee. Moka pot is just a really crude espresso its not for pefectionists.

i4m87wk,2022-04-13 14:11:40,BadPlotDevice,u30bwm,Do I not like good coffee?,You’re overthinking it. Drinking more and more varied coffee will allow you to develop a taste for the complexity of different coffees. That will by necessity also acclimate your palate and send you in search of greater depth. Other people may have different tastes or differently developed palates. A friend who drinks a lot of soda may want more sweetness for example. Another friend who drinks very little coffee may need a shallower flavor until they acclimate.

i4orh7h,2022-04-14 04:30:51,czar_el,u30bwm,Do I not like good coffee?,If you didnt mostly drink med or dark roast Id say maybe your deviation from your friends/others was a signal. But since they raved about it and you found it sweet I just think you have different preferences in coffee notes.   Most people are used to bitter and roast notes so when they try a specialty coffee with naturally sweet floral acidic or funky/musky notes theyre blown away. You cant get those notes from Starbucks/McDonalds/Hortons so they think it *must be* good specialty. By your descriptions you just like the darker roast notes.   Good specialty roasters can source and make good coffee across roast levels and notes. But it is true that the majority focus the majority of their offerings on light or medium roasts these days rather than dark (because those roasts show off the more subtle notes than dark roast and it sets them apart from Starbucks/grocery store darker roasts). That maybe explains why you deviate from indie coffee shops in addition to your friends.  So you arent wrong and its not that you dont like good coffee. You just happen to have your preferences not align with current trends in specialty roasting. Drink what you like and dont worry about it.   Keep testing alternative roasts because pallettes can and do change on their own (after a few funky natural processed bags I go back to a classic bitter/roasty bag like a pendulum) but dont force yourself or feel you need to refine it more.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u30bwm/do_i_not_like_good_coffee/i4orh7h/'

i4ohea9,2022-04-14 02:26:42,cym13,u30bwm,Do I not like good coffee?,Id say that there are two kinds of good.  The first and arguably the most important is the one that tastes good to you. And you seem to know what you like so no issue there.  The other one is good as in an interesting quality product. Aside from the fact that you dont like the taste does the coffee have special characteristics? Maybe characteristics related to its variety? Are they expressed clearly? Are you able to tell what the roaster went for with this coffee? Do you think that goal is reached?  When assessing the quality of a product aside from personal preference is whether it tries to do something interesting and whether it succeeds and even if you cant know what their goal was with certainty it allows the right questions. Ex: is big brand coffee good? They blend in so many coffees that you dont taste anything related to the variety so on that front its as uninteresting as it can be it has a generic coffee taste. But on the other hand they probably reach their goal to have a stable coffee flavour over the years.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u30bwm/do_i_not_like_good_coffee/i4ohea9/'

i4oxil6,2022-04-14 05:28:40,sreiches,u30bwm,Do I not like good coffee?,If I’m drinking anything with milk in it I want it to be smoky slightly bitter and have a rich texture.  But when I’m drinking my coffee black I prefer clean sweet floral cups (generally with tart berry or stone fruit notes).  Coffee is 90% preference. Just as some beer drinkers enjoy primarily IPAs while another likes something malty like stouts/porters and a third may exclusively gravitate to sours and lambics.  Notably I did a mini coffee tasting for my little sister for her birthday last year with my mom and older sister there. I brewed an “espresso” blend a single-origin washed Ethiopian and a natural process Colombian for them all using the same pour over method. The goal was to start them with something familiar and show them some of the breadth of what was out there.  Everyone liked the first two though they had different preferences between them but my little sister wasn’t a huge fan of the third (natural process often has a fermented flavor to it and she wasn’t keen on that).

So how many years are you talking about?  Myself I have always loved coffee.  In the early 90s I lived near a really excellent roastery.  I would get a different coffee there almost every day and I learned what I really really like in a coffee.  Some of my preferences (not all!) aligned with what was considered best at that time.  Now here we are decades later.   I live elsewhere and I still love coffee.  Yet it seems coffee as a Hobby(!!!) has moved along.  I  have gone to local roastery and had really good coffee.  I could appreciate this coffee - I can taste these different taste elements.  Aaaannnddd.... i had no desire to drink any more of it.  It feels like work like an exercise in appreciating it.  But I dont really enjoy it.  It seems that my preferred tastes in coffee are no longer aligned with what is currently sought-after.  BUT part of the purpose of having an interest in coffee is to be able to replicate for Ones Ownself the coffee one likes best and not be dependent upon others to make you a cup you might not like as much.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u30bwm/do_i_not_like_good_coffee/i4prerx/'

i4puehu,2022-04-14 09:21:01,Eileithia,u30bwm,Do I not like good coffee?,Taste is subjective - I think a lot of people fall in to the trap that they *should* like it because its expensive traceable single origin whatever. Its not about developing a palate or whatever. You just like what you like. Appreciating something for being what it is is different from actually enjoying it.  My partner hates light-roast specialty coffee. The few he will tolerate are the ones that taste more like traditional coffee. A light-medium roast washed Columbian is about his limit.  If it has any fruit notes or acidity to it hell drink it but hell bitch about it the whole time. You can forget natural process coffees entirely LOL.  I have a few other friends in the same boat. Some love 3rd wave coffee some hate it. A lot of 3rd wave coffee is trying to make coffee that doesnt taste like traditional coffee.  Tea-like fruity Ethiopians are a classic example of this.  If you blindfolded someone whos never had it and had them drink it coffee likely wouldnt be the first word out of their mouth.  Youre not wrong for not liking something you dont like and theres nothing wrong with enjoying the cheap stuff either.  Coffee definitely hits the same point of snobbery as wine in a lot of cases.  Just because a wine is $10000 100 years old and made from some super rare strain of grape doesnt mean you have to like it. It could taste like vomit and there will be connoisseurs who say its the best thing in the world because of its pedigree and nothing more.

i4mpswc,2022-04-13 16:13:55,Jalabaster,u30bwm,Do I not like good coffee?,Seconding this advice.  One of the hardest parts of falling down the food/beverage rabbit hole is building a vocabulary to describe what you do and dont like.  Try to take a moment to slow down and actively taste things - even if its just a PBR a PB&J or a can of yoohoo that sat opened in the fridge for a couple days.  It doesnt have to be high class to deserve a few moments of thought.  Try things that are super similar side by side and ask yourself how they differ.    Split a cup of coffee into two portions and add a bit of water to one to dilute it.  Taste and compare. Or pour half into a slightly chilled mug to drop the temp by a 10-20 degrees.

For context I generally brew a light roast V60 moderately fine grind 16g coffee to 240-250g water in about 2:30-3:00.  And yes the altitude correction assumption is true.

i4lse7q,2022-04-13 12:26:09,VorareV,u2xdfw,Pour over: How important is a variable temperature kettle?,I guess it comes down to how you brew. Let’s say you do the Hoffman method which uses right off the boil. No need for temp control. However what if you decide you want to try another method say tetsu 4:6. That method uses 92 if I’m not mistaken.  Buying without the controls might prevent you from trying other methods and experimenting though they usually cost more.  That being said some here has suggested that you can achieve the same result with different temps so then the other arguments are somewhat irrelevant.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2xdfw/pour_over_how_important_is_a_variable_temperature/i4lse7q/'

i4lx1is,2022-04-13 12:57:08,golden_boy,u2xdfw,Pour over: How important is a variable temperature kettle?,Id argue that your altitude is a major advantage for non-temperature-controlled kettles. Generally anyone whos not brewing right off boil uses a temperature range of 195-205 staying on the higher end for lighter roasts and lower end for darker roasts. So yeah the marginal benefit you would get from a digitally controlled kettle is meaningfully less than youd get at sea level.  Having that level of control is kind of nice anyway but it probably takes the digital version from smart immediate purchase territory to Christmas list territory.  The only other thing to note is that an electric kettle might be faster and more energy efficient but I dont think thats by a substantial margin.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2xdfw/pour_over_how_important_is_a_variable_temperature/i4lx1is/'

It also depends on your grinder mine is annoying to adjust so its much more convenient for me to make small adjustments to temperature.

If youre the type that likes to change recipes and see what happens when you change temp etc a electric kettle with variable temp is great.  It also has more uses (tea etc) and it just makes your workflow easier in general.

I have a 1000W 0.7L kettle variable from 40-100C. It’s always on the countertop and gets used at least 5 times every day.  Precisely heat a water bath for delicate heating (baby bottle chocolate butter) add to whatever is on the stovetop warm drinking water small-scale home brewing tasks sourdough pasteurizing etc.  Plus if you set to just under boiling you can fill it pretty much to the brim not just to the line.

Milk alternatives like Soy Almond and Oat do not usually have as much fat. Also the contents can [separate](https://simplyoatmeal.com/why-is-my-oat-milk-separating/).  The first thing I would do is give it a thorough shaking before pouring this should create a little bit of foam initially as well as mix everything together.  Also you can check whether it [contains gellan](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/10324-getting-nondairy-milks-to-froth) which is an additive used specifically to help with frothing.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2u2zn/foaming_oat_milk/i4lx9yv/'
i4pbc82,2022-04-14 07:15:42,Alienturnedhuman,u2u2zn,Foaming Oat Milk,Yes I understand that. My question is that why when I add a tiny tiny part of regular Alpro to Minor Figures (so 95% MF / 5% Alpro) does it stop the Minor Figures from forming at all. I cant stress this enough the Minor Figures on its own will foam too well more than regular dairy extremely stable foam.   I get that the Alpro might be lacking a component to foam by itself (although it used to foam before they launched the barista version in Japan) however the forming agent is present in Minor Figures and gets completely neutralised by Alpro suggesting there is something in Alpro interfering with it.,i4ltfsl,/r/Coffee/comments/u2u2zn/foaming_oat_milk/i4pbc82/'
i4l1n6m,2022-04-13 09:34:40,Alienturnedhuman,u2u2zn,Foaming Oat Milk,No not unless its part of one of the organic ingredients but I dont think thats the case.,i4l0xic,/r/Coffee/comments/u2u2zn/foaming_oat_milk/i4l1n6m/'
i4pmw8g,2022-04-14 08:32:41,Alienturnedhuman,u2u2zn,Foaming Oat Milk,When I try the Minor Figures on its own it gets super foamy (actually more than I want) as well as having a strong oaty taste (unlike the more neutral flavour of the regular MF) - that was why I tried adding a splash of regular Alpro to try and reduce the foaminess and also lower the intensity of the oaty flavour.  However just a tiny splash completely stopped the MF from foaming at all and this is what my post is about - why would a tiny amount of Alpro stop the milk that is normally super foaming from foaming at all. And I mean it no foam at all its not reduced its completely stopped from foaming. This is what makes me think there is something in the Alpro actively stopping the foaming.,i4lx9yv,/r/Coffee/comments/u2u2zn/foaming_oat_milk/i4pmw8g/'
i4pdn2r,2022-04-14 07:31:34,swroasting,u2u2zn,Foaming Oat Milk,Yeah I dont know how to help you there.  The Minor Figures Barista which I get here is terrible - it doesnt hold foam at all and tastes like water.  Its one of my least favorite.,i4pbc82,/r/Coffee/comments/u2u2zn/foaming_oat_milk/i4pdn2r/'
i4l1yul,2022-04-13 09:36:43,Tsunominohataraki,u2u2zn,Foaming Oat Milk,No it’s a common defoaming agent based on silicone also used as a drug.,i4l1n6m,/r/Coffee/comments/u2u2zn/foaming_oat_milk/i4l1yul/'
i4po8hx,2022-04-14 08:41:22,No0ther0ne,u2u2zn,Foaming Oat Milk,That is indeed strange and I have not come across that before but I have not used Alpro.

i4pmdw2,2022-04-14 08:29:18,Alienturnedhuman,u2u2zn,Foaming Oat Milk,This is my first time trying the barista version of Minor Figures and I dont like it as much as the regular MF. The regular MF has virtually no additional flavour essentially only adding texture to the coffee which is what I want from a milk as I drink light roast coffees and dont want to mask or change any of the coffees flavour profile.     However the Barista version has a very strong oaty flavour which surprised me as I assumed as it was designed to pair with coffee it would take even more of a back seat.,i4pdn2r,/r/Coffee/comments/u2u2zn/foaming_oat_milk/i4pmdw2/'
i4sso71,2022-04-14 22:42:49,Alienturnedhuman,u2u2zn,Foaming Oat Milk,The Alpro was always difficult to foam with a wand but it was always possible to create a thin layer. Because I seldom make lattes I don’t know when it changed but I noticed a coffee place started using a barista version of Alpro for their oat milk and that usually means a version of their milk that foams. I think that they have tweaked the regular to make it more like the texture of dairy when drunk by itself (and for plant mills this usually makes them less good for foaming in my experience) which would be reasonable it’s just really weird how it’ll a splash stopped the other milk from foaming.   I figured if anywhere on the internet would know it would be here but I accepted it was probably a long shot. I’ll try adding it to other milks that foam well and see if there’s a pattern.,i4po8hx,/r/Coffee/comments/u2u2zn/foaming_oat_milk/i4sso71/'
i4l030s,2022-04-13 09:24:53,crdolce,u2tu2c,Are fines increasing my drawdown time?,I use a baratza encore which is also not the most consistent and sometimes have this issue. Lance Hedrick has a pretty aggressive swirling technique that helps to trap fines against the side of the filter that I have found helps with the 4:6 method.

i4lq2pr,2022-04-13 12:09:51,01100010x,u2tu2c,Are fines increasing my drawdown time?,Is the problem your draw down time or that you dont like the resultant cup?  I was overly focused on draw down times for years. In the last few months Ive pretty much been ignoring draw down time and focusing on technique to maximize flavor.

I have a C2 and it makes for perfect pour-over every time in my Chemex. Took me a few brews to find the perfect grind though.

i4k6wj7,2022-04-13 06:07:16,il-Ganna,u2ovo8,An entry-level home espresso machine for a few hundred,The Dedica is a good starter machine in your price bracket if you do not wish to go manual. What grinder do you have? I suggest that you pair it with with something like the JX Pro to get the most out of it and keep you happy for longer. I would even say maybe future proof your grinder with something like the Niche as that will serve you even on a different machine but I dont want to assume that you can extend your budget.  It might struggle a little bit with lighter roasts as generally these machines dont go hot enough but as a beginner Id still stick with medium-dark roasts anyway until you gain some confidence. A light roast espresso is tricky even in the hands of experience baristas and a high end machine.

i4k45m7,2022-04-13 05:45:12,MaddabbaM,u2oe3n,Is the Breville Barista Express good enough for commercial use?,Probably not.  There are broadly speaking 3 categories of machines commercial pro-sumer and consumer.  BBE would most likely fall under consumer.  Commercial machines are often bigger made with heavy duties parts (think wiring plumbing and gaskets etc.) and designed to be used daily for 100s or 1000s of drinks.  They require maintenance and a good cleaning schedule but will last years if well maintained.  Pro-sumer machines are higher end espresso machines for the home.  Their prices can easily reach into the $4k+ range.  They are designed to be used daily making multiple drinks and are constructed using quality material.  Unlike Commercial machines these typically only make one drink at a time thus for a busy cafe they may not be ideal when compared to a 2 or 3 group head Commercial machine.  Consumer machines are everything else from the bottom upward to pro-sumer.  The BBE would most likely be in this category.  The draw backs are cheaper components inside the machine to keep the price low.  This means you could quickly wear it out in a cafe and need to replace it. It will also be slower for the work flow as you will need to top it up with water constantly and it may not always keep the water hot so you will need to wait for the boiler to heat up.  All  business should make a business plan to see if it is feasible to open the business.  In addition to other aspects you will want to consider how many customers you expect per day per hour and how many in a peak rush when you open the business.  Next consider how those numbers may change with the growth of your business.  What you will want to examine is whether or not the BBE will be a bottleneck for you.  At what point will you need a faster more reliable machine.  And consider what will you do if the BBE breaks down?  Fix it or replace it and the associated cost of that plus downtime.   Also consider how much espresso will you need to make maybe 9 out of 10 guest only want drip coffee in which case you probably could use a BBE for a while.  Hope that helps.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2oe3n/is_the_breville_barista_express_good_enough_for/i4k45m7/'

In reality its pseudo science that fundamentally doesnt work as extraction isnt a linear process and you can achieved much easier results with just 5 equal pours.   If you look at the TDS he was aiming for and his dose used you got something like 16.8% EY meaning he was aiming for under extraction. This works in a competition as he built this recipe on a very specific coffee but imo as championship aeropress recipes it isnt very transferable to the home  Nowadays for V60 I use Jonathan gagnes recipe but I still do like Hoffmans one. For my shagg X I just do 5 equal pours first one works as a 35 sec bloom and the rest I start pouring really aggressively just before the water reaches the bed,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2o1d4/what_do_you_prefer_for_v60_hoffmann_or_46/i4k40e5/'

I use a Hoffman style method and I feel very guilty that I am grinding at espresso level but I love it. I get rich full bodied sweet coffee where I can identify all the tasting notes no bitterness and the draw down times are normal. If I grind courser I get less flavour.  Its so fine it would choke a Flair. When I hear people advise course grinds or suggest grinders that cant grind fine I dont know why its so different for me or if they are missing out on what their coffee could do.  Maybe its my moderately hard water? What type of water are you using?

Personally Americano is my standard order when I just want a coffee to sip away at while I work. In my experience pretty much all speciality shops will do them in the UK and Ireland. And I dont think many differentiate between Americano and Long Black. The internet tells me that Long Black is water with espresso added whereas Americano is the other way around but from what I can see I usually get water with espresso added when I order Americano.  A lot of people will say you should just go for filter if you want a larger cup. In my experience filter from a good speciality shop can often have more complex flavours but I prefer the mouthfeel of Americano - it feels thicker somehow.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2nwgc/the_long_black/i4jyacd/'

My first thought was the Niche Zero machine  And getting a v60 to do a pourover while im getting ready to buy the machine.

i4mqmvz,2022-04-13 16:19:59,Meinhard1,u2mtbh,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I’ve arrived at a great place in terms of my home brewing.     When I got out of college and my income improved I quickly subscribed to Mistobox also ordering the occasional coffee based on coffeereview.com’s write-ups  A few years back Hoffmann’s Areopress videos improved my daily cup and helped me understand how to dial-in recipes for different beans.  I also put some covid stimulus money into a Le Nez du Café to aide in coffee tasting.  For Christmas last year I got a fellow EKG which while a bit superfluous makes it easy to titrate water temp for my Areopress brewing.  And recently I splurged on a Comandante … this  hand grinder with quality unimodal stock burrs has improved my daily cup considerably.  Also I do admit to using bottled water Crystal Geyser though environmentally burdensome.  So I’ve definitely arrived in a good place and perhaps will stay content as long as specialty coffee exists.  But I’m wondering if anyone has insight into what might come next?   Do I nix the bottled water?  Is it true that where Areopress wins in consistency pour over wins in quality?  Or does someone move on to espresso (sounds way too challenging and expensive?),-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2mtbh/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4mqmvz/'

i4l8x9u,2022-04-13 10:20:42,devnop,u2mtbh,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,> Im thinking about switching from nespresso completely.  Do it. You wont regret it.  > My first thought was the Niche Zero machine  And getting a v60 to do a pourover while im getting ready to buy the machine.  The niche isnt considered very good for pour over but thats grading on a scale that smashes anything a nespresso could do. If you plan to focus on espresso then that is a fine plan. If looking to continue both brew methods then hand grinders tend to be more versatile for both pour over and espresso at entry level prices. If wanting an electric grinder for both then entry level is probably a df64.  I know what you mean about the Gaggia looks. It looked kind of sad to me at first compared to the flashy designer pieces but over time I have come to appreciate the utilitarian look as a design classic of its own so it would be sad to rule it out for that. If wanting something with espresso bling but at affordable prices I would look at the Lelit range. If wanting features then I would look at Breville (aka Sage) but to me they are uglier than the Gaggia but will help you make better coffee with less modding. If looking to buy beyond the typical entry machine then youll have to spend some significant time researching what features matter to you and whether you want a heat exchanger dual boilers flow control and such.  If you are totally new to the coffee game then dont underestimate how little you might need to be happy. I dont personally like milk drinks so a v60 and a hand grinder is basically my end game and makes my ideal coffee.,i4jpgpc,/r/Coffee/comments/u2mtbh/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4l8x9u/'

As far as machines I’ll be starting with a Breville Dual Boiler then may move to something like the Linea Mini down the road once I’ve built up my skill set but there seem to be plenty of good options out there for your needs/budget.

i4mvzga,2022-04-13 16:59:20,VibrantCoffee,u2mtbh,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Theres no guarantee that 1:2 tastes best. For a dark roast its probably in the ballpark. For medium or lighter a longer ratio (more water) would likely taste quite a bit more balanced (less sour).   Does your machine have pre-infusion? If yes how long is the pre-infusion? Shot time of 44s with no pre-infusion is a very different thing than a shot time of 44s if the 44s includes 15s of pre-infusion.  What grinder are you using? What water temperature?

i4muk4j,2022-04-13 16:48:43,VibrantCoffee,u2mtbh,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,A plastic V60 is super cheap so theres really almost no reason not to give it a try.  You are right espresso is expensive to do right. Challenging not really any more so than pourover. In fact Id almost argue its easier because the machine does the same thing every time (if you have a good one) whereas with pourover the physical pouring that you do is a variable.  Where do you live/whats your local tap water like? You might be able to just do something like a simple Brita filter on your tap water and get great results. Or it might be horrendous.

Thats the absolute baseline and only goes up from there. With my flair though I pull cafe quality shots love it. If thats just not for you I highly recommend checking out the Prismo mod for the aeropress.

i4l3bkc,2022-04-13 09:45:11,devnop,u2mtbh,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,One recommendation I have for beginners that I dont often see is to buy beans in bulk e.g. a kilo and batch them up for the freezer. Not only do they get much cheaper when you buy in bulk but you can then more fearlessly experiment with grind size dose and method and once you hit on the parameters you like you still have enough beans left to enjoy them.  I feel sorry for beginners that buy 200g of something special and will have run out before they have dialed it in or too fearful of trying out extremes of dose/grind just to see what happens.  As for the type of bean I would find an online service with good prices. The ideal is a local roaster that stocks nearby cafes so you can actually try a cup before buying. I would go for a bean with tasting notes that sound attractive to you personally. Id steer clear of anything too unusual and expensive until you have more confidence e.g. if something like grapefruit isnt something you look for in your coffee then leave that one for now.,i4kx57b,/r/Coffee/comments/u2mtbh/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4l3bkc/'

If youre planning to mostly do drip/pourover get a drip/pourover focused grinder. Closest in terms of grind quality but smaller than the Bunnzilla is probably Baratza Vario-W+. With the metal grind chamber they are now pretty solid for espresso too so you can use it for that if you pick up a Flair at some point.  Edit: Vario is definitely louder than a Niche (they are weirdly quiet) but unless you have a 2 month old baby in the next room I just dont really see grinder noise as an issue.

i4onv2b,2022-04-14 03:50:42,TheManther,u2mtbh,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Per the manual:  >CLEANING THE GRINDER Day to day cleaning - use the included brush to brush away coffee grinds from the burr from underneath.  >For a more thorough cleaning using the included ball driver loosen & remove the screw that holds the handle in place (do not lose screw). Remove the handle. Unscrew the Adjustment Ring completely. Pull the Adjustment Ring with inner burr & axle attached through the grinder & out the bottom. This will allow access to all surfaces of the grinder for cleaning. Assembly is reverse.  >More invasive cleaning may be undertaken by removing the top bearing plate after removing the handle as above allowing open access to the hopper. Use a soft cloth for cleaning the hopper. If you choose to wash any or all parts of the grinder use mild detergent rinse well and dry thoroughly before reassembling.  >Do not put in the dishwasher.  >Removal of the outer burr carrier from the hopper is not recommended only because you must be careful when you reassemble to maintain correct burr alignment.  Frankly my recommendation would be dish soap + water and dry with a soft cloth. You are probably fine using alcohol on those surfaces just as youd likely be fine using an espresso cleaning powder like Cafiza or a grinder cleaner like Grindz.,i4ofxsv,/r/Coffee/comments/u2mtbh/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4onv2b/'

i4ljccq,2022-04-13 11:26:39,devnop,u2mtbh,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yeah I appreciate both povs - the ideal case is bulk buying a large variety :)   The challenge for a beginner is about both breadth - knowing the type of bean they like but also about depth - knowing how to get the most out of it. If they never learn how to get the most out of a bean then they cant properly evaluate different beans. If they rapidly rotate between small batches then I fear they are not learning but getting only the most superficial and imperfect impression of each bean. I wasted specialty coffee by not knowing how far to push parameters which is why I now think volume is important for a beginner to give them freedom to explore.,i4l96ht,/r/Coffee/comments/u2mtbh/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4ljccq/'

For the coffee Im on now I know which setting I liked it best so far. I never revisit a coffee so a lot of this journaling seems like it wouldnt be useful as soon as Im done with the coffee. Even if I were to try and extrapolate but region and roast I switch up my equipment or brew device so instead of it being in a journal its all by learned knowledge now. I feel like a journal is probably insanely helpful when youre new to coffee or temporarily when you make a big change like the grinder and the one time I found it necessary for myself was when I tried to switch coffees and grinders daily and needed to remember settings for multiple variations. But for one cup of coffee a day I dont think its necessary and every time Ive tried the habit Ive dropped it for the time-cost to benefit ratio.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2k9d6/elevating_your_coffee_experience_with_pen_and/i4jmww5/'

Do you know whats weird? It really doesnt. Its just a thought stream. Sometimes its just good cup of coffee could do with a touch more extraction or sometimes its as crazy as roast level 5/6 fruit level 2/6 acidity 3/6 sweetness 2/6 highly concentrated and good for milk drinks...  What it does do though is it makes me think about the drink Im having just that bit more. Makes me really pay attention to the cup. And that to me isnt homework its magic.

There are coffees out there for everyone.  Personally I drink enough (two cups a day) that a subscription to Pact is my go to. I go for their mid-range Select plan as it has a variety of flavours whilst always nailing those chocolatey and generic coffee flavours every time but with a whole lot of depth of other flavours on top of that. Not had a bad cup from them yet.  As others have said your local roasters would be worth checking out. They can give advice on grind flavour profile etc all to your taste.

i4ipv2k,2022-04-12 20:15:11,oriboaz,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,I would make a few recommendations:   1. Weigh your dose. Perhaps a little less coffee in the portafilter would do the trick. For consistency I always weigh my coffee and use WDT for proper distribution.  2. If the portafilter is pressurized (the basket would have only one real hole) consider getting a non-pressurized one. This will improve your espresso dramatically. 3. Get a small hand grinder and grind your own beans. A good one is the JX-Pro by 1zpresso. It’s about $160 so not inexpensive but for the price you get a very good grinder.   Remember that espresso is a journey and upgradeitis is a real condition. With time you will want to improve your setup as you outgrow the capabilities of your current equipment.   Here’s my journey (bulletted for clarity):  * I started with a Breville Barista Express. (An all-in-one semiautomatic with an entry level grinder)  * Two years later I bought a Niche Zero grinder which elevated my coffee to a whole other level. This is when I learned to use the WDT. This makes a huge difference and I highly recommend this.   * A year after that I bought a Linea Mini espresso machine which again elevated what I could produce.  * I bought a bottomless portafilter which taught me a lot about puck-prep and improved my method.  * Then I improved my water.  * Most recently I discovered that the coffee cup you use makes a big difference. For me Ceramic >> Glass and reactive glaze ceramic is even better than regular ceramic. Also using nice cups (with matching saucers) just bring me great joy. I balked at first at the cost of some cups but after eyeing a particular one of about a year I broke down and bought one cup+saucer set… and proceeded to buy three more because it brought me so much joy.    I‘m quite happy with my current setup but I still have thoughts about upgrading in the future (that Olympia Cremina looks real nice…),-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4ipv2k/'
i4ii60d,2022-04-12 19:16:24,LeiLei2008,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,If you are using pressurized basket (only one tiny hole in the middle of basket) yes very fine grind may clog it so choking the machine.   Likely your machine is alright. You just need to switch to a coarser grind or if you want to explore espresso more you can switch to an unpressurized basket (but doing this you may encounter other issues like opening a can of worm…),-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4ii60d/'
i4j9t4n,2022-04-12 23:35:07,AlexFZ,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,Sounds like it’s just choking your machine.  Generally means some combination of the grind being too fine tamping too hard and too large a dose.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4j9t4n/'
i4ikldm,2022-04-12 19:34:29,Et2097,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,I am having the same issue with a similar style machine. I’m planning on trying a less fine grind next cup I make. Let me know how that works for you,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4ikldm/'

To solve the issue I use lesser pressure to tamp the grind.

i4lrgls,2022-04-13 12:19:25,IronCavalry,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,I encourage you to come join r/espresso which can offer more espresso specific advice from helpful users.  Coffee has to be ground quite fine for espresso and dialing-in particular beans for a particular machine can be tricky. Too fine or too coarse and you have issues with flow like youve encountered. The over/ under extraction would also result in some espresso that doesnt taste great.  Espresso tends to be a lot less forgiving than other brewing methods when it comes to grind size. My advice would be to seek out a good burr grinder and unpressurized portafilters for your machine. The investment will be worth it for much better coffee.  I have a Eureka Crono grinder with Eurekas espresso specific burrs. Its amazing for the price about $300 CAD.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4lrgls/'
i4j0or0,2022-04-12 21:50:31,ruwheele,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,Espresso should feel a bit finer than table salt in your hand but will still clump together when pinched. If it is more like powered sugar it is too fine.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4j0or0/'

i4l4vhh,2022-04-13 09:54:50,LeMeJustBeingAwesome,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,It sounds like your portafilter is clogged from using too fine of a grind. Use a slightly coarser grind in the future but you will probably need to clean your portafilter in the meantime. Cleaning a pressurized portafilter can be a pain but I recommend [this guys solution](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/15952/cleaning-a-clogged-espresso-machine-portafilter) of burning it over a gas flame to burn any particles caught in the holes and then cleaning it with water to rinse anything out.  Also strongly recommend you consider getting a grinder so you can get the grind size perfectly to you and your machines liking. The freshness will noticably improve the flavor of your espresso too,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4l4vhh/'
i4lobzj,2022-04-13 11:58:26,PersistentElephant,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,Ground too fine. You can just put less coffee in there to reduce the resistance and probably get some use out of the Starbucks grind if you dont want to waste it. With a pressurized basket itll still come out recognizably espresso-y.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4lobzj/'
i4ir1nx,2022-04-12 20:24:49,esperalegant,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,> consider getting a non-pressurized one. This will improve your espresso dramatically.  This is true but only if you have a grinder and can dial in the beans for your machine. Especially if you have budget machine with not exactly 9 bar pressure then youll need to tweak the grind size to make it work. If you dont have a grinder Id probably recommend sticking with a pressurized basket although do try both since baskets are not expensive.,i4ipv2k,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4ir1nx/'
i4k0im8,2022-04-13 05:13:45,badlybougie,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,I would also recommend that OP ignore all these suggestions and just get a coarser grind that works with his machine if he’s happy with his current setup and morning espresso,i4ipv2k,/r/Coffee/comments/u2fkcd/espresso_machine_issues/i4k0im8/'

i4iqo0b,2022-04-12 20:21:42,esperalegant,u2fkcd,Espresso Machine Issues,Any beans are fine just get them to grind them a bit more coarse.

i4i6gp4,2022-04-12 17:53:26,barrycburton,u25ok6,Warning about buying from Bonavita (Brewista too),The reason I posted this is I also read the incorrect information on this sub and wanted to correct it. Its bizarre to me that people are defending Smartco when the information that they suck is easily available both by their own admission in the screenshot I posted and some great reporting at [https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/the-rise-fall-and-potential-resurrection-of-a-coffee-brewing-legend/](https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/the-rise-fall-and-potential-resurrection-of-a-coffee-brewing-legend/)  If you want to understand the issue then you should really just read the article but TLDR Espresso Supply was the original US distributor. They did not go out of business and they fought Smartco ending their relationship. On Smartcos new distribution website they blame Espresso Supply for not fulling warranty claims but court filings say that Espresso Supply was unable to handle warranty claims because Smartco ceased fulfilling Espresso Supplys orders. Relevant quotes from the article:  &#x200B  >   So Gross was hired by a Chinese manufacturer named Smartco to build out what would ultimately become the Bonavita trademark. In 2012 Smartco entered into a trademark agreement with a Washington-based distribution company called Espresso Supply Inc and began selling the brand’s kettles and brewers nationwide. Both Espresso Supply and Gross declined to comment on this article.     \[...\]  &#x200B  >   The relationship between Gross and his Chinese manufacturer began to sour. In 2020 Smartco sued Brian Gross for breach of contract and trademark infringement in relation to Brewista.      \[...\]  &#x200B  >   At the beginning of 2021 Smartco informed Espresso Supply that it was ending its trademark agreement with its distributor of nine years. “At the end of the day we had an agreement — and contract — and it expired” said Carolyn Chen a vp at Smartco who is also helping relaunch the Bonavita brand. “When we tried to renew terms we couldn’t come to an agreement.”   According to court documents that’s not exactly how Espresso Supply understood the matter. A motion filed in 2021 by Espresso Supply alleged that a Smartco employee (Carolyn Chen) “​​sent an e-mail to Espresso Supply’s President stating that the IDA \[international distribution agreement\] was being reviewed by Smartco ‘for updates & such (for example the named party will need to be changed to Smartco Int’l HK instead of Smartco Int’l Asia Ltd). Once the review has been done we will send to you.’”   A month later the legal motion went on “Smartco’s President Steven Ku sent an e-mail to Espresso Supply erroneously stating that the IDA expired.” Following that “Smartco ceased fulfilling orders from Espresso Supply.” What’s more Espresso Supply alleged in the court filings that Smartco began working with competing distributors and pricing the products below the agreed-upon price-point. (The case was later dismissed by a judge over a dispute of the terms of contract – which Espresso Supply is currently appealing.)   According to the court documents Smartco stopped fulfilling orders in the beginning of 2021. As a result Espresso Supply could no longer offer customer service sell new devices or do any type of business with newly-made Bonavita products Espresso Supply still held the keys to the website and the social media accounts but the manufacturer wasn’t giving its former distributor any product or support.   Smartco’s telling is a little different. The company declined to go into details about the move to end the trademark agreement but likened it to a messy divorce.  “We did everything we could do to make a nice transition” said Chen. “Bonavita is a nice brand and we didn’t want to lose that.”,i4i524z,/r/Coffee/comments/u25ok6/warning_about_buying_from_bonavita_brewista_too/i4i6gp4/'

Thats very interesting stuff indeed.   Having worked in retail marketing much of my life I totally understand the risk and challenges of having your entire line of business tied to just one brand even one thats your own brainchild. Its happened to a company I worked with before where they brought in and distributed a certain brand built it up painstakingly and successfully until it was the top in the local market and it was so successful that the manufacturer went ahead and decided to set it up its own shop here bypassing the distributor completely.   $$$ really has a way of making some people assholes especially when their job is to make more $$$ and not to serve customers.,i4i6gp4,/r/Coffee/comments/u25ok6/warning_about_buying_from_bonavita_brewista_too/i4i7y1f/'

The average price for a 250gr of good light roast (African beans usually) over here is anything between €750 and €15 before going into the slightly more expensive ones. That said you dial in the beans you have. It’s not like you can dial in a lower tier one and the “transfer” that dialing in onto a new pricier bag… man I wish it was like that 😄 Some times I’ve got to slightly re-dial in halfway through a bag (guess it’s degassing doing it’s thing… or just my tastebuds adjusting).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u21upr/want_to_explore_light_roasts/i4g5wq9/'

i4gih68,2022-04-12 11:03:19,Vernicious,u21upr,Want to explore light roasts.,Coming at this from a different perspective from the responses so far: Ive been using the aeropress for close to 15 years I think... I dont think of the aeropress as a dial it in method. I mean for just the joy of experimenting you can do all kinds of fun recipes.  But in general aeropress is mostly self-dialing in the sense that if you decide on one method you wont get huge swings.   Whereas a v60 requires more dialing in and from what I understand espresso even more.  And then on top of that dialing in only works on that particular coffee - -on the v60 at least dialing in one bag of coffee might not get me to dialing in a different coffee even if theyre both light roasted.  And on top of that bad quality coffee masks the differences tweaking and tuning can bring out.  In short Id just say get good coffee and go to town.  Of course there are good coffees that are less expensive and good coffees that are more.  But get good coffee.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u21upr/want_to_explore_light_roasts/i4gih68/'

I wouldn’t go further than that unless it’s something really specific that you really like.  Of course not that you shouldn’t for any reason just that it’s not like you’re missing all of the meaning of coffee brewing behind the 10 bucks threshold. My average for single origin is around the €8 per 250gr and it’s always on the “man that’s a really good consistent damn nice roaster” level with sporadics “I’ll get that 15-20 bucks bag that sounds like it’s worth the extra penny”.,i4gy92c,/r/Coffee/comments/u21upr/want_to_explore_light_roasts/i4h1f0y/'

However quite a number of design mistakes are wasting what can be a perfect grinder for value and for amazing coffees.  I have set myself the goal to make the DF64 as perfect as it can be by adding modifications and rethinking the design. The main issues are the following ones:  * Declumper + Retention * Popcorning * Grind size indicator * Plastic cup * Tilt angle * Static  I have already designed 6 different parts to deal with the above mentioned issues and the goal is within reach. The last issue to be tackled is to redesign the chute.   If someone wants to implement these solution or is just curious of my journey you can check out the parts here: [https://www.etsy.com/shop/Camperista3D](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Camperista3D).

i4ga4vf,2022-04-12 10:11:55,wipny,u20ey1,Option-O Lagom Mini package meddling and burr theft,My first guess was customs opening up the package and meddling with it.   If the burr was swapped I’m guessing it was a swap and return from a shitty customer that the company failed to check.   I don’t think a fulfillment worker would do that sort of thing but who knows.    I’d wait to hear what the company says.

If thats the case you can use the Timemore C2 no problem. Grind on the 12 click youre good to go.  The other ones are an older generation of hand grinders the grounds it produces are very irregular and take a loooong time to grind so i definitely dont recommend not for espresso nor filter coffee.  What youre reading about the C2 not being suited for espresso is true but theyre talking about non pressurized portafilters which require very fine adjustments on the grind size on the process of dialing in. In that case you need a 1zPresso JE or JX-Pro or a Kinu M47 all of them significantly more expensive than the Timemore C2.

Also hope that opening it didnt void the warranty but I dont think that thats necessarily the case anymore. I dont know for sure though.   The risk if doing it yourself is to actually void the warranty so in case something goes bad you will have an issue.

i4esxyh,2022-04-12 03:37:39,Schrottibaer,u1vl2c,Sheared screw! Delonghi Dedica 685,There might be nothing else wrong with it but there are multiple risks there. One would be that this specific machine has more issues and you cant return it when you repaired it yourself earlier. Another one could be you making a mistake and therefore breaking it or being unable to source the right components. Lastly you might have tinkered with it but changed the screw or whatever but thats not fixing the problem because its something else. Then you are stuck and cant really necessarily return it. You would have screwed yourself up.   I love trying to fix stuff but I always look at the risks first. I didnt dare to fix my 2000€ keyboard myself while I could still return it because it I tried and failed the money spent would have been down the drain.

i4habte,2022-04-12 13:58:01,akraut,u1vepy,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Im aware that Im definitely cheating since Im using the fancy-pants automatic steam wand on a Breville Oracle. HOWEVER what Ive noticed is that the second jug of milk I froth doesnt get thick froth like expected its thin but at temperature. It also sounds very different. The first mug sounds normal: a low-ish hallow sound ramping up to a paper tearing sound. The second mug sounds like a high-pitched tearing sound all the way through.   Ive thoroughly cleaned the steam wand using Rinza and it still happens after the first mug. (Also the breville blasts steam in about 5 bursts automatically after each frothing session to help clear the wand and Im dutifully wiping it completely clean with a damp rag.)   Any ideas? Im also throughly certain that its entirely something Im doing wrong.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1vepy/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4habte/'

i4hdkvy,2022-04-12 14:18:37,IRunChinaTown,u1vepy,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Cold brew problems  I’m addicted to Starbucks cold brew so I decided to buy some pre ground cold brew coffee and make some on my own. I made sure to buy coarse grounds specific for cold brew and after letting it sit for 16 hours I strained it with 4 layers of pretty fine cheese cloth. The taste was pretty good but the texture was gritty and there were lots of left over grounds. I assume I can just strain it again with cheesecloth but it would take another 4 layers to catch anything and if it didn’t get it all the first time I doubt it would the second. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to use another system to strain? Could it be the brand of grounds?,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1vepy/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4hdkvy/'

In your case I think it would be fine unless they are preground beans. I assume two different brands will have two different grind size which can lead to uneven extraction. This might especially be true for the mokapot as it is somewhat a preasurized brewing method.

You can go to a fabric store and buy 1 yd of unbleached cotton muslin cloth for $5 and use it to strain your cold brew. The fabric has a tighter weave and won’t let the fine grit pass through.    Launder it with hot water and unscented soap or baking soda before use. In between uses after wringing it out you should keep it in a container in the fridge submerged in water.   If you leave it to air dry the coffee oils oxidize and will leach a nasty rancid flavor to your cold brew.

Older machines are generally better suited for tinkering which is why people pass them on after a short period.

If you were buying it from a technician who had stripped down and rebuilt it and was giving a 12 month guarantee I would say... maybe? Price is a bit high because it could be anywhere from 2 - 8 years old I guess.

I wouldnt buy one that old personally but there is still a market for them and people are buying them to use commercially not just for parts and tinkering.

Acetic acid is quite water-soluble (why it’s dissolved in water in the first place).

i4fbd6t,2022-04-12 06:25:14,MaximumAdagio,u1oytq,Machine for laundromat?,Do you have an online store where you sell your beans? A QR code linking to your store can be a good way to get people to check it out on their phones. A couple of local roasteries & cafes near me started selling online in 2020 at the start of the pandemic and it seemed to work pretty well for them.  What machine to get depends on the environment youre installing it in - how busy it is what kind of monitoring there is and so on. Regardless youll want the coffee brewed at your laundromat to reflect well on the quality of your roasts so be prepared to clean + maintain it well. Drip coffee makers tend to work well for a lot of people so Id go with something higher quality than a $12 Mr. Coffee but not as high as say a Moccamaster given that itll be used in a public environment.  Coffee tends to be better when ground fresh right before brewing but obviously thats another machine youd need to get so as long as you can deliver fresh pre-ground beans I think that would be fine.  Not sure if there are any good single serve brewers where itd be easy enough to pre-fill pods with grounds in bulk as Ive never looked into it. That could be a convenient option for your customers at the laundromat as it would personalize the experience and avoid the chance of them coming in to a pot of stale coffee somebody else brewed hours ago.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1oytq/machine_for_laundromat/i4fbd6t/'
i4g781h,2022-04-12 09:53:48,JenRJen,u1oytq,Machine for laundromat?,Assuming you dont have a problem with theft or etc...  You might try placing an airpot with the daily coffee with the very-small size cups Kind of like the way Trader Joes always used to provide samples of their own coffee.  There are many coffee places who still have at least some of their daily coffees pre-made in airpots and this is a good way to have folks trying your coffeee.  IF you are intending to sell it... without an attendant... well again depending on the level of honesty amongst your laudromat clientele airpots with honor-system funding theoretically Could work.    Otherwise -there are coffee-vending machines that grind and brew and the beans sit visible in clear holder on the top.  (I think this is a vending-version of an all-in-one machine?)  Local Toyota dealership has one of those (they have removed the money-requirement but you can see its designed for it).  Holds probably not more that a pound or two of beans per option so it will be nicely fresh and the coffee from their machine is pretty good if they used great beans Im sure it would be even better.   Regarding vending machine for bags of roasted coffee.  Vending machines take dollar-bills and credit cards nowadays so there is No Reason you could not use a vending machine to dispense roasted coffee.  (Id suggest making sure your bags are positioned with the roasted-on date clearly visible.),-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1oytq/machine_for_laundromat/i4g781h/'

They have vending machines that sell [all sorts of stuff](http://www.jofemarusa.com/category_s/121.htm) and they accept credit card payments.

i4fvfv3,2022-04-12 08:40:42,Trotski7,u1oytq,Machine for laundromat?,If you want it to be a self serve kind of thing with your own beans right by the side (pre ground up or have an electric grinder near by for ease of fresh brewing) then you could research and get some kind of auto drip machine like from cusinart or something middle-end that isnt expensive high quality gear but still good at making the coffee. Or you could have an easy to use single serve kind of thing like an aeropress (with instructions nearby) with beans nearby probably would have to buy multiple presses though.  If you could swing it though it would probably be expensive would be to hire a new worker just to brew coffees for the patrons. Have some v60s or other pour over options to sell small/medium sized cups to the people. But that would be expensive and costly in many ways but would be a unique feature for the laundromat. Could also sell simple stuff like cookies/etc too as well as the beans themselves.   I think your best and easiest bet though is what I first suggested. A medium range machine that makes quick cups and doesnt ruin the beans that people (or your employees) can use at will. Either selling small cups of coffee for really cheap/free but selling the beans along side it. Up to you really.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1oytq/machine_for_laundromat/i4fvfv3/'

One of the things I love about sensory hobbies (especially manual tactile and taste hobbies like coffee) is the intense focus and attention to detail it requires and inspires.   So many studies have shown the benefits of meditation and flow states. I think really getting into something like a hand-ground V60 pour over is a mini version of that. Sure its not as intense as a true flow state (which can take some time to enter) and maybe not as impactful as an hour long meditation. But the small acts of focus and attention repeated every day (lets be honest -- multiple times a day) help rewire your brain to be more receptive to that stuff.   Keep brewing and doing my friend.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1mzan/coffee_and_how_it_got_me_to_seek_help/i4fa5zg/'

One of the Pope Pius declared coffee a truly Christian beverage which led to its widespread adoption in the West.

Sometimes the little things make all the difference in the darkness. As others have said definitely express the sentiment of this post to your friend - it is always nice when people are reminded that small acts can have such a huge positive impact.  I had a really bad time with mental health in my early twenties and honestly going to my local coffee shop each day was a huge part of what kept me going. Something to focus on look forward to and get me out of the house. Also the small interactions with other customers and the baristas made a positive impact on me every time. Honestly it was an expensive habit to buy coffee from a cafe everyday but it made such a difference that I do not regret it one bit.  Heres to brighter years and plenty of nice coffees ahead of us.

i4deuc8,2022-04-11 18:39:50,provism,u1m5o0,Cold Brew Ratio in Cups,Depends on whether you want to make a concentrate or not but I think you should still use a ratio. Ive found a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio a bit wasteful due to the amount of water retained by the ground coffee. Aim for a 1:5 perhaps.  Just measure however many cups 12oz of coffee is then add 5 times that in water.      12oz = 1.4371 cups (dry coffee)     1.4371*5 = 7.2 cups (water)  As I dont understand the imperial system to check my maths I converted into metric then back into imperial.             12oz = 340ml          340*5 = 1700ml          1700ml = 7.2 cups  So somewhere just over 7 cups. But as I said ratios work for volume and weight just measure whatever volume of dry coffee then add 5 times that in water. The power of learning a ratio is it will scale up and down infinitely regardless of your starting weight/volume.  Cold brew really isnt that much of a science but for what its worth I would recommend investing in a semi-decent set of electronic scales. Something with 0.1g accuracy will only run you about $10-$20 and is super useful for other things such as cooking and baking. Something like this: https://www.amazon.com/KitchenTour-Digital-Kitchen-Scale-Multifunction/dp/B07G9DNNGF/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=gram%2Bscale%2B0.1g&qid=1649727201&s=home-garden&sr=1-6&th=1  Ive got a few cheap scales off amazon that have lasted me years. Now upgraded to a much nicer set of Acaia scales but they accomplish the same goal at a much higher price - a bit unnecessary but a piece of kit I use everyday so I appreciate the luxury. Honestly an accurate set of scales is something I consider life changing. I once got my friend a Christmas gift of scales similar to the one I linked above. They turned their nose up at it initially but actually thanked me weeks later for how useful they were.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1m5o0/cold_brew_ratio_in_cups/i4deuc8/'

i4ddk87,2022-04-11 18:30:37,landenone,u1m5o0,Cold Brew Ratio in Cups,I just typically ratio by volume in cups. 1 cup ground coffee to 4 cups water.

At this point I would take James hoffmanns advise that only upgrade if it’s going to solve a specific problem you’re having. So keep at what you’re doing until you feel you’ve hit a wall that you can’t get passed with what you have.  Another point to be aware of different beans usually need a tweak to grind settings and timings to get the most out of them.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1l564/new_to_the_world_of_coffee/i4d1d55/'

i4mx1tb,2022-04-13 17:07:05,redTygr,u1l564,New to the world of Coffee,Make coffee every day and pay attention to it. Find a good starting recipe: Hoffmans V60 or Lances first video on v60 are detailed but with practice easy to replicate. Id say focus on the v60 first before pouring too much time into the neo as it is much less forgiving. For me learning to taste was a slow experience where every day I tried to be as consistent as possible and then I tweaked grind from there.   From the equipment you have you should really have enough potential to reliably make really good coffee. Id say to make sure not to blame equipment or upgrade soon but let yourself taste how your own technique can improve.

Its just a fairly consistent source of points to all competitors - people who will lose points on technical dont make it to nationals or worlds so that means that winners are effectively wholly determined by the combination of patter and investment.  And youre absolutely right a huge portion of success is moneybean - all the way from the specific beans and ingredients being sourced all the way down to the competitors access to hardware ability to waste resources on practice and capacity to spend their own time on practice either unpaid or paid by their backing org.  It requires a pretty substantial support system to make a competitive run and success in competition is highly biased towards the best-resourced competitors.,i4cxmcg,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4dmvl2/'

There’s a lot more technical marks in barista than brewers. You actually have a technical judge in barista comp where they look for tamping flatness ground distribution timing and hygiene among others. Brewers you don’t have technical marks the head judge looks at how you brew take notes of the time pouring etc but no marks given mostly for reference if the coffee tastes somewhat wrong. Brewers put more focus on coffee sensory service and presentation that’s all no technical really unless you’re really bad that it ruins your presentation. Barista puts greater emphasis on technical along with sensory presentation creativity and service.   So on technical elements a lot more focus on them for barista comp just that if you screw up technical marks you really won’t be at national level. Yes both comps are now really mostly a contest of who can get the most expensive beans. But with barista you really need to get your technicals down while brewers you can have an excellent coffee and good presentation and it would beat someone with good coffee and excellent presentation as judges are humans too and if they really enjoy the coffee they’re more easily convinced that the presentation was equally good. This is why I’ve lost interest in judging nationals it’s turning into who can spend the most money or time to get the best beans rather than the focusing on service and skills.,i4cxmcg,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4hjlk2/'

Im one of the judges for this years USBC finals. I had never heard of Morgan Eckroth until I saw them onstage at the USBC this year. I heard they had a large social media presence and so out of curiosity I watched one (1) tiktok video / instagram reel of theirs which had no direct relation to coffee the day before I judged their routine.  During their routine they gave out menu cards that included a link to a video of their signature drink build and to make sure that the video did not influence me in any way I did not watch the video until after my final scoresheet was handed in and the winners were announced and neither did any of my fellow judges. The scores I gave them are indicative of what I tasted and what I was told and observed during those 15 minutes on stage nothing else.  to your point but there wasn’t a lot of emphasis—to your point—on the technical elements the source of the coffee or that connection that is being built with the farmer. Each barista competitor has two technical judges who are capable of awarding up to 54 points per judge or 108 points of their theoretical maximum of 752 points. Those numbers of points can make or break a competition.  No barista who doesnt demonstrate technical mastery of their craft is going to win at this level.  As a sensory judge of the 162 points Im capable of giving 6 is the maximum that I can give for presentation and professionalism (24 across all four judges) which is where the source of the coffee or the connection that is being built with the farmer would go. The thing that get you the big points are excellent tasting drinks. I can absolutely see a world in which winning USBC involves absolutely no talking beyond giving flavor calls and really excellent tasting drinks.  &#x200B  (edit: added second two paragraphs),i4dwo8e,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4g8wa1/'

i4hcnob,2022-04-12 14:12:41,Anomander,u1ka3h,Morgan Eckroth (Morgan Drinks Coffee) wins the US Barista Championship 2022 coached by Lance Hendrick :) Congrats Morgan!,Whats being commented on here is not *that* money can be an advantage - but *how much* of an advantage it can be and how that conflicts with some how how Barista Comps like to present themselves.    Barista comps and competitors tend to style themselves as a relatively accessible everyman format - something thats open to skilled baristas of all walks and something where competitors barista-ship will win out.  Ideally its framed as something that being good at being a barista or working as one with modest top-up practice should serve to prepare a competitor for.    Many competitors and outsiders dont necessarily understand how huge of an advantage cash can purchase - that for instance in a competition where your station is competition-provided there is still room for contestant-provided the best gear to constitute an advantage.  Many of those people are unaware that how *massive* an advantage competitors choosing their own beans is despite being aware that competitors can do so.  The vast majority of folks are unaware that working as a barista is not worthwhile practice - for a barista competition - and the competitive format rewards *not being a barista* and drilling the stage routine instead.,i4gmod0,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4hcnob/'

Every competitor this year needed to work onstage on a Victoria Arduino Black Eagle 3 group espresso machine and either a Mahlkönig E80 or EK43 grinder. The disadvantage here is not so much about who can afford rad stuff to use in competition but who can afford the exact machines used in competition to understand exactly how theyre going to behave once they get on stage (the grinders retail for $2-3k and the machine will run $30k for the exact same model).,i4ifh1m,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4l78yz/'

It’s there to basically check whether the participant is capable of brewing other coffee than theirs with their equipments. My guess is that they don’t do this with barista because the espresso machine water and sometimes grinder (some competitors bring their own grinders) are already standardised where in brewers you can make your own water and use different brewers pouring kettles grinders etc you don’t even grind in front of the judges most competitors do this backstage only in compulsory you use the provided water and grinder if I’m not wrong.,i4hlfqi,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4hzvsq/'

i4hzvtb,2022-04-12 17:05:59,sprobeforebros,u1ka3h,Morgan Eckroth (Morgan Drinks Coffee) wins the US Barista Championship 2022 coached by Lance Hendrick :) Congrats Morgan!,First you show up to a qualifier or a preliminary comp and you say you want to volunteer as a judge.  You show up a day early for calibration day during which you and a bunch of very experienced head judges taste a bunch of espresso and a bunch of milk drinks and theoretical milk drinks and some volunteers run dummy competition routines.  You keep doing things until basically everyone agrees on tasting things and describing what theyre tasting until they all are more or less describing the same things and have a similar vocabulary and most importantly are assigning the same drinks the same numerical scores.   The competition head of that particular qualifier or pelim will then assign judges slots depending on how well they did. If the judge is a total novice to the judging world they might get one or two panels or they might even get a guest judge slot where youre there to be a warm body for a competitor to serve drinks to but isnt actually writing scores that will be used. Generally people who are good at tasting and also crucially are good at writing about what theyre tasting will be remembered by the head judges and competition committee and will be specifically invited back to subsequent ones. If youre really good at it and have done multiple competitions the head of that competition can vouch for you and invite you to the national level.,i4h6veu,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4hzvtb/'
i4ubn6x,2022-04-15 08:27:29,sprobeforebros,u1ka3h,Morgan Eckroth (Morgan Drinks Coffee) wins the US Barista Championship 2022 coached by Lance Hendrick :) Congrats Morgan!,This has been addressed at Barista comps and our (imperfect) solution is that all judges now need to go through mandatory implicit bias training.  Youre absolutely right these are factors that can affect judges and bias training isnt guaranteed to fix the problem but it is worthwhile that occasionally if one judge is way out of calibration with others that a head judge might ask about personal bias and sometimes it does help.   &#x200B  Personally as Im standing to the side of the stage about to walk out and meet the competitor I have a moment of quiet meditation where I think this could be the next United States Barista champion as a reminder to myself that it could be anyone depending on what drinks are served and what they taste like.,i4tqw6m,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4ubn6x/'

Not to knock them at all I think Morgan is great but I had figured that a competition like this would have been significantly more competitive but that didn’t seem to be the case at all.  I was shocked that Morgan provided their own equipment to stream the competition to their YouTube channel.  On the other hand having not seen the other presentations I guess I don’t know how competitive it really was but from the people who won on the website it seems that most of the winners are very young (like under 25 at the oldest) whereas I had expected a much older and experienced demographic for the competitors.,i4d4m3z,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4dq2jn/'

This phenomenon happens in pretty much any competition with a subjective element for example skateboarding acting and art.   She still probably had the best drink recipe presentation or whatever those skills are why she got famous.  I was rooting for her to win too because she seems genuinely a positive person.  If you don’t think judges don’t consider the contestants popularity even subconsciously you must assume all authority figures are infallible.

i4htgfr,2022-04-12 16:19:48,Anomander,u1ka3h,Morgan Eckroth (Morgan Drinks Coffee) wins the US Barista Championship 2022 coached by Lance Hendrick :) Congrats Morgan!,Competitors trend 20s-30s range no matter how much passion you have for coffee most people have moved on either to bigger things in-industry or left the industry entirely past mid-thirties or so.    If youve moved into management or production-side you dont have time to be a barista competitor.  You might have the passion still and the resources but you do not have the time.  If youve left the field even more so - I could probably self-fund a competitive run these days but Id have to quit my job and burn savings to do it.    The scale of commitment tends to weed out the older competitors while barista skills fading off over time means that an older person with ten years of experience but working in roasting for a few years would show less experience than someone young whos working bar full time right now.    The few people who are older passionate and still working in barista roles *overwhelmingly* tend to be poorer minorities and working for businesses that dont age-filter staff or have space to promote experience - a combination of personal factors and business factors that both typically mean significantly fewer resources to make a meaningful competitive run than a young person at a trendy and wealthy company.    Last factor being that there are very few competitors that win nationals who return again the next year.  For the most part its such a commitment and so many resources committed that companies will rarely try to field the same competitor several years in a row if theyve already got the bragging rights of a title - and optically its better branding for the company to generate multiple champions than it is to have supported one repeat champ.,i4dq2jn,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4htgfr/'

From browsing the comments in this thread then Id say at least one of those judges would have absolutely hated that shes popular on YouTube and TikTok thought she was leveraging her popularity as an advantage in the competition. It doesnt seem like that happened because she won. So either she was such a good competitor that even the judge who disliked her social presence had no choice but to give her a good score or she had a metaphorical thumb on the scale for the same reason or they just did their jobs and judged her on predetermined criteria that she trained for.,i4fovpm,/r/Coffee/comments/u1ka3h/morgan_eckroth_morgan_drinks_coffee_wins_the_us/i4frn2g/'

When you’re used to the sugary stuff it definitely makes sense to start at the sweeter Starbucks beverages. Liking coffee for the taste of coffee is not an instant process for a lot of us. I went from Chai Tea latte to a caramel latte to a caramel latte with just one pump of syrup to a regular coffee with cream and sugar to…. Well nowhere. That’s where I am today and I maintain that there’s nothing wrong with that. I do brew at home and enjoy trying different beans but i’m still going to put almond milk creamer in it.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1g3u5/update_1_getting_into_coffee/i4c8fs9/'

I think a lot of folks in this sub would say that the drinks youve mentioned are closer to sugary desserts than coffee but they certainly are tasty.  As someone else suggested try hitting up a specialty coffee shop and trying some drinks there -- a light roast pourover can be a door into a totally new world of coffee.  Edit: Look into getting an aeropress (theyre super affordable) and grinding your own beans at the grocery store.

I took the instructions and the bag of beans plus the ground beans I prepared for the demo followed the instructions then shared the final product with all of them.  They could not believe how naturally sweet the coffee was and were surprised by it. It was pretty cool to see their reactions. That location was displaced by a more modern drive-thru store and everybody hated working the DT so all of those awesome folks left for other jobs.

In that case the Breville Precision is top of line all the bells and whistles including a single cup option.

You have to play games with the filter basket/drip stop and stirring and then you might as well be doing a pourover.

i4byeuu,2022-04-11 12:36:24,AidGli,u1etbv,Return a bag?,not to be mean but since you just started drinking specialty coffee there is a chance (and i would say it’s most likely) that you don’t know what to look for yet or the way that you are brewing might not be right for the coffee or you may have just bought a coffee that you don’t like. If you could point to a specific defect other than the fact that you didn’t like it then maybe it would be reasonable but i think you just bought something you don’t personally enjoy which is not the stores fault at all. just view it as a learning opportunity and try to identify what is different about the coffee you bought so that you can figure out what may be the factor that is different from the coffee you do like.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1etbv/return_a_bag/i4byeuu/'

i4bd0d3,2022-04-11 09:58:03,jazzb54,u1brs4,Coffee subscriptions: how quickly do you reach your optimal brewing settings when you receive a new bag of different beans?,I usually keep everything the same (25/400 100C Medium fine grind) for the first cup and then adjust from there.  I get mostly light to medium so they usually come out correctly.  If Im trying something different from my usually types or the first batch tastes really weird Ill try cupping the second batch.  8g/150mL and slurp it as it cools.    If I was previously grinding a particularly funky wet light Ill take the grinder apart and give it a good clean before trying again.  From my experience once youve dialed in your grind and ratio for lights/mediums you dont have to adjust much.  I always brew with 100C water and never tweak the temperature because that doesnt really matter.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1brs4/coffee_subscriptions_how_quickly_do_you_reach/i4bd0d3/'

Have done malibar gold for example on an atomic kick at the moment with 3 bags ordered or here.  I have found that adjusting isnt difficult and I dont waste many beans when the roast level is similar.  However with that said it depends on roast date and the toaster.  I have a local company that is extremely hit and miss.  Great taste when its good however I have had bags that dial in 2uickly and the exact same coffee purchased a month later cant get dialed in despite a recent claimed roast date.   I have lost confidence and just quit buying their coffee as I think they may not be honest or have quality issues since I havent changed my process.  Because of this quality control challenge I dont really trust subscriptions.

i4baj27,2022-04-11 09:42:34,I_AM_THE_REAL_GOD,u1brs4,Coffee subscriptions: how quickly do you reach your optimal brewing settings when you receive a new bag of different beans?,I am a noob but usually if you get something similar in terms of roast level you can just use your old settings and adjust from there. Also depending on your brew method immersion styles are pretty forgiving. Usually the first few days I brew great coffee and then it drops off from there becoming very mellow. Not sure why maybe its half stale. One other thing to note if your grinder retains a lot of coffee and you keep changing beans it might taste weird from the cross contamination.  The only problem I have with coffee subscriptions is if they do not allow you to choose any preferences and sometimes they send you something you wouldnt normally buy. For me I prefer light-medium roast fruity stuff and wouldnt normally pay the same price for a bag of medium-dark roast stuff.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1brs4/coffee_subscriptions_how_quickly_do_you_reach/i4baj27/'

i4b95px,2022-04-11 09:33:51,techwizrd,u1bbfd,Best Coffee Beans?,Im not sure you can really define best since flavor is subjective^1. I would look into a coffee subscription service and try coffees from a variety of different places and flavor profiles: Guatemala Mexico Costa Rica Ethiopia Kenya Malawi Yemen Indonesia etc. Most will ship within 1-2 days of roasting  so its a good way to try a variety of fresh coffees and learn what you like.  Try to pick out different flavors using the SCA [Coffee Tasters Flavor Wheel](https://sca.coffee/research/coffee-tasters-flavor-wheel) ([Interactive flavor wheel here](https://notbadcoffee.com/flavor-wheel-en/)). You can try to use the [triangle test](https://www.sensorysociety.org/knowledge/sspwiki/Pages/Triangle%20Test.aspx) to be more scientific about gauging best for your palate. Some roasters and coffee shops also do tasting workshops or sell samplers so that you can compare/contrast different coffees--that might be more economical than buying lots of bags of coffee from different origins.  Lastly have fun exploring and know that your palate will evolve--things you might dislike today might become your favorite tomorrow.  ^1: There is a coffee tasting score that grades coffee on a 100-point scale (specialty coffee being 80+). But that score doesnt necessarily translate to your enjoyment of the coffee. A coffee might technically have a high score but not what you enjoy (e.g. you might not like fermented flavors or stonefruit notes in your coffee).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u1bbfd/best_coffee_beans/i4b95px/'

i4ba7dn,2022-04-11 09:40:31,G_lamsay,u1bbfd,Best Coffee Beans?,There are so many factors in terms of coffee bean variations that it comes down to preference. The best way to find your preference is to just try some. If you are trying to find your favorite(s) based on country there are a few guides that can give you a general taste profile of the country’s coffee the more general the better because the person who should determine what something tastes like to you is yourself. But in terms of good coffee overall one of the best ways is to find the freshest locally roasted coffee.

My first suggestion honestly for better coffee is learning how to brew fresh ground beans properly. Even some whole bean Peets Big Bang or Major Dickason from the grocery store can be very impressive if youre brewing them correctly.  Some important considerations: water temperature ratio of grounds to water used consistent grind appropriate grind size roast date of beans when beans were ground clean equipment proper brew times filter used (or not). <-- you can buy $50/lb beans and still make crap cups of coffee if these parameters are too far off from ideal.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u160mj/looking_for_a_so_called_drinkable_coffee/i4a8i0i/'

Coarser yes but there will still be some exceptions especially if youre using high dense or low dense coffees where both produces different particle sizes on the same grind setting. Another thing you should take into account is roast degree. 2. Yes and no. Depends on what you want. I do drain mine always after the first and second pour. 3. Just do gentle pouring to prevent fines migration and I only stir once during bloom and after the last pour.  4. 500g so 200g on the 40% and 300g on the 60%. You can adjust the first and second pour depending on what you want to highlight (increase first pour for acidity or increase the second pour for sweetness). For the 60% this is where you adjust the body or tactile of your brew. Divide it either by 2 3 or 4 pours though I think 4 is too much.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u15qzq/46_pour_over_advice/i4aqbhx/'

Several months ago I got a coffee from a roaster and thoroughly enjoyed it: it was full-bodied not bitter and had notes of milk chocolate and almonds. I bought the same coffee just last week and my experience is very different: Im getting a strong bitter note and the coffee tastes somewhat flat overall. I thought I might need to clean my grinder (and I probably do!) but I got lazy and tasted another coffee without cleaning the grinder and this other coffee tasted fine. So what might be going on? 2. Another coffee from the same roaster had notes of molasses candied orange peel and bittersweet chocolate. I brewed some last night and set it in the fridge to drink this morning and I swear it tasted like a melted mocha frappuccino: no molasses no orange no bittersweet chocolate just coffee ice cream and chocolate ice cream with a hint of 90s mall food court.

I’ve read here that generally light roasts extract better at high temperatures while darker roasts at slightly lower temperatures.   Also lighter roasts may taste better at higher ratios vs darker roasts. I typically prefer a 1:18 brew ratio.

I don’t switch between beans until one is finished for the most part. Specific settings don’t mean much but I have a Vario and an Aergrind and can share rough guidelines if that’s useful to you.   Grind settings vary per bean but generally I can get dialed in within 2-3 cups. Once you have a decent idea of where to start (i.e. a bit coarser for African coffees that will produce more fines) it’s pretty straightforward,i4bj8os,/r/Coffee/comments/u145hl/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4bvnrc/'

i4k11sa,2022-04-13 05:18:35,coral225,u145hl,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Generally yes. Elevation will impact how the cherries ripen. Some roasters will put the elevation information on their bag or website and you can become familiar with certain regions/mountains over time and keep an eye out for them. The roaster also matters as lots of sweetness is drawn out in the maillard process of roasting but the beans and processing method usually make the biggest difference. Naturals and honeys are also often sweet but its usually not that bright sugary sweetness you can find in washed beans.,i4jbqw8,/r/Coffee/comments/u145hl/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4k11sa/'

Depending on the size of my batch I might just dump the whole thing into a big mixing bowl and then use a strainer to scoop the grinds out.   All Im looking to do here is get as much solid material out as I can because the next step is running it through a coffee filter. Ive found the best way to do this is just throw a filter in my chemex and pour everything through that. Depending on how big the batch was I sometimes have to swap the filter out once or twice (too many fines will eventually clog the filter – I suppose I could rinse the filter and re-use it havent tried that).

First decide on a dose this depends on your basket size. For mine I use a 18g dose.  Next decide on an output goal. Do you want a ristretto or espresso or lungo. If you don’t know what this means just go for dose x2. So if you followed 18g in. Expect to brew for 36g out. Get a 0.1g scale it’s worth it.  Next distribute your coffee in the basket post grinding. Make it nice and evenly spread within the basket. Use a toothpick if you have no needles.  Next try to tamp the same strength every time. If you want a way to visualize your tamp put a weighing scale of suitable size under your portafilter and press get used to the same strength every time.  Next the grind and time adjust finer until your brew time reaches 30 seconds to achieve your target output (36g out for 18g in). Time is the result of the grind and distribution and dose. But you want to target it to be done at 30 seconds.  Try that,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u13tix/puck_is_wet_and_shot_does_not_look_good_what_am_i/i49w897/'

Some of the steps of the C2 are within espresso range but the finer you grind the more small variations become important (because theyre a big variation relatively to the grind size).

After months and 30+ emails of back and forth (with many delays getting responses) they were unable to solve my problem so I gave up and returned it all.  I suggest the Turin DF64 (EspressoOutlet is a good spot to get one in my experience).  If you want a better grinder in the future you can choose to upgrade to SSP burrs for $200 but the stock burrs are supposed to be pretty good.  See James Hoffmanns review comparing it to the Niche.  The general complaints are:  * aesthetics: its not the best but doesnt look bad * retention/regrinding: just remove the silicone declumper its easy. Use a spritz of water and buy a cheap mod to position the dosing cup closer to the spout and you wont have problems with mess  Other complaints were pretty picky such as the power button being inconveniently located or the lid being awkward as Hoffmann says.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u10gnf/should_i_buy_the_fellow_ode_the_baratza_encore_or/i49gf80/'

i49natt,2022-04-11 00:48:28,rnmennell,u10gnf,Should I buy the Fellow Ode the baratza encore or something else?,A great question and really it depends on what you want to do.  Reset a seasoned bur? A brush some wrenches and time.  Grind for super tiny granules? A shim.  Grinding a lot of different roasts or different grinds? A single dose hopper and a good scale.  Want to try exact grind levels or get rid of fines? A sifter set.  Ground 500 pounds of coffee? A new m2 burr.  For a faster grind for Espresso? A Sette if you want to stay in brand otherwise what you want to consider for a grinder is:  1. Motor stats   More power or more speed is a balancing act.   Faster is more popcorn but finer grinding... eventually because the last few keep jumping around.   More torque is better crushing but slower and noticeably so when theres a lot of beans. 2. Burr type and stats   This is where you get into possible grind sizes consistency and noise. Both burr types can do extremely fine grinds all the way to Turkish. 3. Hopper   jumping around from bean to bean or roast to roast? Get a single dose.   Know exactly how you want it or want to do larger batches? Get a bigger hopper.  Want total control of the grind and really wanna do it by hand? A mortar and pestle. No joke if you really dont have anything else to do or just want to try it grab a set and go to town and really dial in that particulate size. You can do some absolutely crazy things up to and including expressing oils if you really want to.  Remember the most important upgrade to any grinder brewer or method: A piece of paper and a writing instrument so you can really play around and find what you like.,i49m54n,/r/Coffee/comments/u10gnf/should_i_buy_the_fellow_ode_the_baratza_encore_or/i49natt/'

Its a serviceable home **espresso** grinder. Today its my *everything* home grinder and it isnt horrible for a single dose. Turn on pulse mode go till gone.

I actually went with it over a Niche and others after doing a side-by-side comparison of shots pulled. Thats how good their grind is now but its annoying to really have to install the shim if you have a true espresso machine. My first shot was horrible and I had to go back and recalibrate my pallette to roast so I could dial in after putting in the shim.  And this was with a blind tasting. I was blown away.

There are plenty of videos on youtube really showing that a lot of typical espresso coffee milk drinks have kind of just... mixed in the milk jug with each other in all but LITERALLY name. But anyways back onto the question at hand:  # How do I make a flat white at home?  First a note about the drink from the shop thats **whole milk**. So if its not tasting the same make sure to check your milk and make sure its 4%.  Now onto the flat white. Take a strong coffee pod like a Corto and mix it with warmed milk at a 1(part coffee):2(part milk) ratio maybe with some foam if youd like to and can and if not just warmed milk is fine because **do what you like.** Its coffee which is like drinkable science you can do at home. Like baking!  ... and cooking.  Want to foam it too? Just get a mini whisk and whip that warmed milk until you get that foam.  Now here comes the fun part: Journaling! Write down what you wanted what you got and what you think you should do from there.  Too much coffee flavor? Dial it back and go with a 1:2.X ratio in small increments until its perfect for you.  Too much milk flavor? Dial it back and go with a 1:1.Y ratio in small increments until its perfect for you.  Too much yuck? Try a different pod and go back to stock ratios and compare in that series of tests and entries.  By journaling your coffee adventure youll learn what you like what you dont like and what you want. So get a good journal and start writing in it.  You dont need a scoring sheet but you do want a way to remember what you did yesterda.  # Bonus: Milk Tips!  [Heres a good set of milk tips](https://dairyfarmersofcanada.ca/en/canadian-goodness/cooking-with-dairy/basics-how-warm-milk) with a 700 watt microwave so pretty safe youll have one at home or better!

For decent home brewed coffee youll need a grinder decent quality water for coffee fresh-roasted beans a kettle (gooseneck temperature controlled preferable) and some means to make coffee (some pourover device AeroPress or French press usually).  Otherwise youll need an espresso machine for things like a Flat White.  I cant help you as much there but I know they have more manual type ones and more consumer friendly ones.  I recommend James Hoffmans book: The World Atlas of Coffee for a great intro into all of it.  Its a cool coffee table book too.

The danger pertains mostly to large volume batch brews that are sealed up for dispensing via keg. There are a bunch of us homebrewers and small shops who do this though. I sanitize most my equipment but obviously not the interior grinder components. I go back and forth about giving the beans a dunk in Star-San prior to grinding. It definitely promotes exterior oxidation and just oxidation and off-gassing in general because I have to let them dry again before grinding. And grind quality will still suffer as a result. I’ve put them in hot oven again before but at that point I’m usually like Jesus this ridiculous. If I die from botulism it will be a good story.

This one brews a massive mango note along with some sweet lime that smacks of Key Lime Pie. But my favorite note in it is warm honey. The temperature qualifier is important its not just honey its *warm* honey. Imagine scooping a spoonful from one of those cloudy mason jars of honey you see sunbathing at a famers market in the thick of summer. Thats the note. The coffee comes from the Moplaco washing station in Sidamo (an awesome outfit). If Ethiopia is your origin give it a try. Heres a link...

I’m not super familiar with this model of machine. This is a shot in the dark but if it has a PID double check and make sure the water isn’t too hot. If you don’t have a PID and the machine has been on for a while the water might be too hot and turning into stream before it comes out of the group head. So the solution for no pid is just use your machine before the water over heats. 🤷‍♂️,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0rcdf/barista_express_flushing_air_from_the_water_pump/i47vhfn/'

i47cht3,2022-04-10 12:53:43,Mirthgiver,u0p5g7,Question..,Espresso gear is actually something that Sage/Breville does pretty well. There are lots of great single boiler machines you can buy. For example: Breville Bambino Breville Infuser Breville  Barista Express (BBE) Barista impress (the new version of the BBE)Gaggia Classic Rancillio Silvia etc.  They are all very similar machines can be acquired second hand and can produce great espresso. The only thing to watch for is the [pressurized portafilter](https://youtu.be/YbEKjzTkyPk) and [auto frothing](https://cooper.co.je/blogs/cooper-co-1/the-problem-with-milk-auto-frothing-devices-on-espresso-machines) as these can detract from your experience if you enjoy making coffee.  One thing to watch for is the grinder which can easily blow your budget. The Breville/Sage smart grinder works fairly well but it’s probably worth upgrading in the future. The best “all in” solution is probably the Breville Barista express as that has a grinder built in. It’s not amazing but you can always massively step up your coffee game by upgrading the grinder later.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0p5g7/question/i47cht3/'

i47kgxm,2022-04-10 13:49:14,Mirthgiver,u0p5g7,Question..,The pressurized portafilter eliminates the need for a fine grind. This can be useful as it allows you to use old pre-ground beans (if using a regular portafilter you want to be using the coffee within ~3mins of grinding). However you won’t have control over how water interacts with the coffee which makes it much harder (if not impossible) to make a cafe quality shot.  The auto frother will automatically steam the milk for you. Unfortunately the bubbles they make are too big which means the milk and froth will separate very quickly (~3 mins) as opposed to staying as a cohesive thick air filled liquid. It’s also impossible to do latte art and the “texture” is off (more like what you would get from a Nespresso machine than at a cafe).  A reasonably priced option would be a Breville barista express and a quality [hand grinder](https://1zpresso.coffee/). The built in grinder will be fine but having the better grinder gives you the option of using a better grinder occasionally.,i47eky9,/r/Coffee/comments/u0p5g7/question/i47kgxm/'

i48hppd,2022-04-10 17:58:11,Mirthgiver,u0p5g7,Question..,The standalone Breville grinder is fine but overpriced for what it does.

i46z34a,2022-04-10 11:21:07,garbagesobriety,u0kigu,What’s your preferred coffee method for camping?,Of course! We basically fill a giant stock pot with river water and then boil it on a blaster stove. Once it’s boiling we turn off the heat and add 3 or so cups of preground coffee. Let that sit for 8-10 minutes and then strain it with a fine mesh sieve into a big kettle.   I actually couldn’t tell you what coffee it is. My company just buys it in bulk since we go through 3-4 pounds of coffee per trip.  It’s not the best coffee you ever had but it’s what you need for the extra long river days haha. I love some fruity light roast coffee but there is a place for the shitty overdosed coffee we make on the river.,i46tmuv,/r/Coffee/comments/u0kigu/whats_your_preferred_coffee_method_for_camping/i46z34a/'

What can you tell me?,Its very likely the Van Nelle Company (est. 1782) based in Rotterdam.  From the limited info I could find the product was made sometime between when they introduced vacuum sealing (1962) and when they closed (1996).  It looks like it was perhaps made for the international market due to the export moniker and the wording being in English unlike most of their [other cans](https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/from-coffee-and-tobacco-to-unesco-rotterdams-van-nelle-factory) although perhaps it was simply a style choice.  Apparently their main factory is a well-known architectural piece and a UNESCO site.

i45yk17,2022-04-10 07:10:45,Belicheckyoself,u0gkkh,My completed coffee station,No intended snark here but I think in general the coffee subreddit is pretty fanatical about coffee and brewing methods. It’s a lot of people who get single origin beans ground right before brew and brewing after optimal roast date down to the gram and ml ratio at the precise temperature in methods like pour over chemex aero press etc. Seeing nespresso and keurig with the kettle and burr grinder tells two very different stories. Keurig has a pretty negative reputation among coffee artisans.   As I said no snark intended and to each their own. If you like keurig and nespesso drink it! Just many of the posts are more barista and James Hoffman type followers. Check out his YouTube if you’re curious.

i45wtjw,2022-04-10 06:57:13,geggsy,u0gfvc,Pandemic coffee experience,I’m guessing that your lowest score for Ethiopia - Bensa - from your description was likely naturally-processed (check your bag or roaster’s website).  If so you can probably steer away from naturally-processed coffees.  Your first ‘8’ is still ‘very enjoyable’ so I think you’re likely to be well-served with just that advice.  In addition none of your tasting notes are citrus - I would try to find one with citrus notes (lime lemon orange) to see if that’s your thing.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0gfvc/pandemic_coffee_experience/i45wtjw/'
i46t2cq,2022-04-10 10:40:26,Blind_Pierre,u0gfvc,Pandemic coffee experience,Looks like you prefer nutty/chocolate/less punchy notes in coffees except on occasion. The on occasion is where it might get trickier to have input.   Seems like your comfort zone when selecting would be focusing on Central and South American origin coffees. Those typically have the nutty chocolatey figgy sorts of profiles.   African coffees are typically--but not universally--known for fruit notes and brightness. Largely thats true with Ethiopians but theres of course variation in that and Kenyan Rwanda Burundi etc coffees can all be pretty distinct profiles. Playing around more with African countries could give you some breadth but it still seems like Africa wouldnt be your initial focus for finding what you know you like.   As another poster pointed out you seem to be averse to natural processed coffees which tend to be fruitier and juicier. Your comfort zone is likely honey (sort of a middle stage where some coffee cherry is left on) and washed processed.   BUT you also seemed to like the yogurtv strawberry exotic taste of that one which makes me think you could enjoy some anaerobic processed coffees. Its a trendier thing but absolutely makes for a unique taste. Last one I had was like strawberry yogurt or Turkish delight or something.   And in general lighter roasts will reveal the full flavor profile of the coffee more than darker roasts. A rule of thumb I use and have seen echoed here is that a roaster cant necessarily be trusted if most of the coffees are roasted dark or medium. Light roast coffee is trickier and less widely marketable so a lot of light roast options is usually a decent indicator that a shop is being intentional in their roast choices based on the coffees. Shops that can roast light that have medium or dark options likely roasted darker by choice and not convenience.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0gfvc/pandemic_coffee_experience/i46t2cq/'

I usually have at least 1-5 first cups of each bag that are washes - theyre me experimenting with temperature grind level method.

i4arlnb,2022-04-11 07:36:08,VibrantCoffee,u0gfvc,Pandemic coffee experience,At the risk of being overly simplistic it sounds to me like you just like high quality washed coffees (so do I!).

i48plvi,2022-04-10 18:59:50,FLex_4_sex,u0gfvc,Pandemic coffee experience,It looks to me like you prefer coffees with a higher body and lower acidity. In my experience coffees with flavours like chocolate berries/cherries and nuts seem to also be coffees with bolder or more robust bodies whereas coffees with a bunch of different very fruit flavours tend to be higher in acidity. There are a lot of other factors and exceptions to this of course.   If you find this seems to be true for your preferences I would guess that you will have the most luck with washed South American coffees. You may prefer a lower altitude bean overall as well so lower altitude Africans might suit your palate as well.   Also the more experienced you get with dialing in different beans may lead you to enjoying a wider range of flavours in which case I would encourage you to see out honey processed central/South Americans or ones grown at higher altitudes later down the line.   Really cool write up you did!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0gfvc/pandemic_coffee_experience/i48plvi/'

i4cvi6e,2022-04-11 16:17:24,fkdkshufidsgdsk,u0gfvc,Pandemic coffee experience,One thing to keep in mind here is that country of origin has way less impact on the flavor than the roast level processing method or the bean varietal.

i46sgmf,2022-04-10 10:36:26,mategabo,u0ej0o,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread, I think the biggest difference is clearity (pourover is very clear) and body (v60 produce very low body). I prefer lighter roast more fruity coffees with v60 they usually doesnt have much body anyway.   Im rocking a budget setup a plastic hario v60 beacuse i travel a lot it doesnt break and its light (its not pretty but very functional). I just ordered a gooseneck so i cant say about it anything but i think its a must have... I cant produce consistent result with my regural kettle... It doesnt give you much controll about your water pour... (Well i use generic hario v60 paper i think it doesnt make a big difference but its personal preference (in my opinnion))  Pourover is a nice brewing method but requires more technique than the french press (but its worth it) i enjoy the result and the experiments i do with it too.,i468ush,/r/Coffee/comments/u0ej0o/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i46sgmf/'
i47c43z,2022-04-10 12:51:04,wipny,u0ej0o,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Pour over uses paper filters so the coffee is often described as clean with a lighter texture and body compared to French press.   The most popular pour over cone and paper filters you can find in your supermarket is the plastic [Melitta](https://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Coffee-Single-Pour-Over-Brewer/dp/B0014CVEH6) the single cup one. Those take #2 size paper filters.  A nicer looking version of the Melitta made of  ceramic that also takes #2 filters is called the Bee House dripper.   Then there’s the Hario V60 dripper the 02 size. That uses their proprietary paper filters that you can buy online or at your local speciality coffee shop. In the US Bed Bath & Beyond sells them too.   My favorite dripper design is the Kalita Wave 185. Reviews say it’s a bit easier to use and make consistent tasty cups with compared to the Hario. However the proprietary paper filters cost a little more and are a little harder to buy. You can still find them on Amazon or your speciality coffee shop.   For gooseneck kettles I like the iconic design of the Hario Buono 1.2L. It has a contoured handle that makes it easy to grip. I’ve read anecdotal quality issues with made in China model so I’d try to look for the made in Japan one.,i468ush,/r/Coffee/comments/u0ej0o/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i47c43z/'
i46raeh,2022-04-10 10:28:43,robtalee44,u0ej0o,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,its different. Not better or worse but different. Its about the filtering. Some people might describe filtered coffee as lighter or less edgy. I get those descriptions. I enjoy both -- lighter roasts tend to blossom with a filtered setup and using some caution in prep can bring out truly unique favor profiles. I think the Hario Switch might be something to look at as a great starting point. If you want to jump in the Bee House dripper is both nice looking and functional. A good intro is on Stumptowns web site in their brewing guide. Good luck.,i468ush,/r/Coffee/comments/u0ej0o/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i46raeh/'
i471pxg,2022-04-10 11:39:10,elemental001,u0ej0o,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Almost certain that those SP9 brews were amazing because of the grinder used at the shop. Theyre just high volume single serving brewers. If youre looking for something that brews single cups check out the Moccamaster Cup One.

I’ve been a customer for about 2 years and they’ve never let me down.   Their “standard” coffees are $10/12oz with $3 shipping on orders under $40. These coffees tend to be blends or roasted a little darker.   I’d personally spring for their Special Mug coffees at $12/12oz.

i4996xp,2022-04-10 21:54:49,Zarten,u0ej0o,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,For the first step into making coffee I always recommend buying a French press. Its the easiest way to elevate your average cup of coffee. You dont even need a gooseneck kettle to begin because you can just dump water in and call it a day. You can even buy your coffee grounded instead of whole bean (I know BLASPHEMY).  If you ever decide to go further and get even better cups of coffee you can invest however much you want in a grinder and a gooseneck kettle.   There are so many threads on equipment reviews in this sub so you can do that research yourself. Do a deep dive and figure out if this is for you.  If you just want a home machine look for [SCA approved coffee machines](https://sca.coffee/certified-home-brewer).

i49l3gp,2022-04-11 00:18:17,rnmennell,u0ed3u,Tips and advice when working with Ethiopian beans on V60,First things first probably go with the Hoffman ratio for Ethiopian of 60:1000 since its easy to adjust and... well you can use it as an easy starting point for \*any\* roast from light to dark. Then use whatever pouring method you want.  1. Longer blooms.   These lighter coffees want a longer bloom time because they have more CO2. Try going for 50s down to 45s depending on age from roast. 2. Check your temps.   Ethiopian beans like lower temps usually around the 92-96 range is a safe bet start low and climb from there in groups of 2. 92 then 94 then 96. One jump touches bitter? one degree lower should be golden. 3. Start with the standard 60:1000 ratio and adjust from there to find your flavor profile \*after\* dialing the temp.   This step is about strength and flavor profile for enjoyment. This is where dialing your dose is. 4. Enjoy!  Seriously though more people need to get journals for your brew type. Record your recipe your thoughts and the flavor profile if its enjoyable and adjust from there. Really elevates from a ritual to meditation and youd be surprised how big an impact going back to base and recording each different recipe can have!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0ed3u/tips_and_advice_when_working_with_ethiopian_beans/i49l3gp/'

i46dvqz,2022-04-10 08:59:59,wipny,u0ed3u,Tips and advice when working with Ethiopian beans on V60,I have a Blue Bottle dripper which is similar to a Kalita Wave 185. I think following the tips in [this](https://youtu.be/rxR34mURRJE) pouring guide can be helpful.  Natural Ethiopian coffees can be tricky to dial in. I use a medium-coarse sea salt-like grind and use multiple pours.   I use a variation of George Howell’s [recipe](https://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/brew-guide/hario-v60-02/) using 6 equal 15 second pours waiting 15 seconds in between each pour. I found a 1:18 brew ratio tastes good to me.   I don’t swirl my mixture. I found this causes excessive stalling. I also pour gently with a gooseneck minimizing turbulence and agitation. This eliminated the bitter sourness in my cups.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0ed3u/tips_and_advice_when_working_with_ethiopian_beans/i46dvqz/'

i4dhtu6,2022-04-11 19:01:22,Ethril,u0ed3u,Tips and advice when working with Ethiopian beans on V60,I brew 375g water to 22g coffee  I actually tend to go a little finer so that the grind variance isn’t as big.  Around 6.8 to 7.0 on a 1zpresso K Pro.   I’ll bloom nearly at boil but to compensate for the finer grind I’ll let the water drop in temp 2-3 Fahrenheit every pour. I bloom 50g for 45s. Then three pours to 175g 275g and finally 375g.  My pours minimize agitation to minimize fines migration to the filter which reduces draw down and minimizes channeling.  Still though the brew time pushes up past 4 minutes giving it some super clean immersion characteristics.  The keys are first to let the temperature drop during the brew process which I tune more than grind size since fines reduce that capability. This allows me to identify the point of being bitter then leave the kettle off the burner a bit more between pours. I still bloom pretty much off boil and this seems to help extract more of the detail and nuance.  Second minimize agitation. There are still fines that can lead to channeling so try to keep them away from the filter paper. I carefully knock the coffee down the sides at the end of my first two pours by just barely pouring on the thick area of build up. This is quick and the water hits the paper in a place the finely ground coffee I’m washing away will help prevent the water from easily bypassing behind the filter. I swirl once at the very end but it’s ritual.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0ed3u/tips_and_advice_when_working_with_ethiopian_beans/i4dhtu6/'

Hoffmanns method uses a lot less agitation so may be more suited.

i4682eg,2022-04-10 08:20:01,nach0ladas,u0ed3u,Tips and advice when working with Ethiopian beans on V60,4:6 is a perfectly fine method for anything. Comments to try a different method miss that you aren’t exactly doing 4:6 right yet. To do 4:6 properly don’t expect full drawdown. Instead grind coarse and then pour 40g in for bloom. 40 is the sweet side and my preferred since I don’t care for high acidity coffee. Then do the rest in 45 second intervals. Pull the dripper at 3:30. There’s 4:6. This is not an ideal method if you want full drawdown because 4:6 is designed to choke. The Kasuya V60 removes the ridges at the opening for exactly that purpose and I have to say I’ve fully switched from standard v60 to that one because it produces such a good cup of coffee.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0ed3u/tips_and_advice_when_working_with_ethiopian_beans/i4682eg/'

Maybe it was his Kono video... I dont recall off hand and dont have the time to go back and check. I could be wrong.  As I understand it the benefit of a longer bloom is that it ensures full saturation of the grounds which results in better extraction.   Generally there are two ways I extend my bloom. Again this is Hedrick derivative. First is two one minute blooms. The other is one two minute bloom. I believe the first approach results in a higher extraction.

i45ck59,2022-04-10 03:24:47,DiabloDerpy,u0bhqx,first time going to a coffee shop what do i ask for,This post is so wholesome haha. Love it.  Since it seems youre new to coffee a few things:  Keep trying different styles of coffee. Great way to find out your likes and dislikes and its just fun.  The more you drink the higher your tolerance will get and the more reliant you become.  To not mess up your sleep its generally recommenced to stop drinking coffee around 15:00 - 17:00. Depends on your bedtime and how strongly you react to caffeine amongst other things though.  It will probably influence your libido and your toilet habits lol.   What comes up must come down. Yes coffee/caffeine crash is real.  Bit more personal/general advise: Avoid sugary coffee drinks. Sugar consumption is already an issue for most people nowadays. Adding even more is obviously not a good thing. Although when I started out with coffee I also used a bit of sugar.  And most of all enjoy! Maybe (probably) youll end up with your own coffee set up at home like many of us lol.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u0bhqx/first_time_going_to_a_coffee_shop_what_do_i_ask/i45ck59/'

Try something new each time you go to help develop your taste buds. Also caffeine is not always good for focusing though it does wake you up. Some people get jittery and can’t focus.

i437mf3,2022-04-09 15:09:03,Brangur,u024tk,My first attempt at an iced caramel macchiato,Did you remember the vanilla?  Edit: I worked at Starbucks for a long time. in case anyone wants the official recipe:  For 16 oz:  - 3 pumps (basically add slightly less) vanilla syrup  - milk 2% is standard. If its iced add it now  - 2 shots espresso. honestly you can brew them right over the milk. Otherwise use a spoon to slow the pour  - caramel drizzle 4 zig zags in each direction two circles around the outside of the cross hatch  8 and 12 oz only have one shot. Hot 20 oz has 2 iced 20 oz has 3. Though I prefer 2 on a 12oz. Adjust vanilla syrup for size.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/u024tk/my_first_attempt_at_an_iced_caramel_macchiato/i437mf3/'

i41zu35,2022-04-09 09:59:56,Kupoo_,tzx5os,Coffees Shops with Bad Espresso Puck Prep,What you see is the difference on making coffee for yourself with leisure and the need for speed. In commercial setting the workers dont have the luxury of stirring puck with wdt for example as the small time used to do it will build up on crowded orders. They however usually mitigate this with high end equipment top end grinder to minimise clumps good volumetric machines etc. Im not by all means justify the bad puck prep but in respectable coffee places they at least do standard prep but not meticulous to the extreme in chasing one incredible shot. The norm is that it is far better to make 200 of good/ok coffee rather than only 5 incredible coffee at every operational day.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tzx5os/coffees_shops_with_bad_espresso_puck_prep/i41zu35/'

i424iwr,2022-04-09 10:31:20,Firezone,tzx5os,Coffees Shops with Bad Espresso Puck Prep,theres always a scale running from lowest effort to absolute best practices where an individual or cafe lands on that scale can vary heavily and usually depends on how much time and care they can afford to put in their knowledge level and equipment and how likely it is to actually make a perceivable difference to the person consuming the beverage at the end. Some best practices have a pretty low cost in terms of time or equipment required others have a very high cost.   At home youre maybe making yourself and your family a couple drinks in the course of a day the hobby and gradually improving how well you can prepare drinks are probably of much more concern than efficiency of your workflow or throughput of beverages but for an ultra high-volume establishment those 5 seconds it takes to weigh the dose could be tangible and substantial lost revenue over the course of a day. Theres also diminishing returns to factor in ten seconds making sure your dose is right can have a pretty meaningful impact on the end result taking a few seconds to manually distribute the grounds instead of leaving a big mound can eek out a little better result using distribution tools to completely ensure no clumps remain can get you a little further but the time starts to add up for marginal gains.   As other commenters point out milk both dilutes the coffee and binds to bitter compounds meaning the nuance of your perfectly prepared extraction arent quite as critical as they would be in a pure espresso shot. if 90% of your business is milk drinks maybe sacrificing 5% of the potential of the shot is a worthwhile trade if you can crank out an extra 5 drinks per hour.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tzx5os/coffees_shops_with_bad_espresso_puck_prep/i424iwr/'

i44d94k,2022-04-09 20:44:04,yahat,tzx5os,Coffees Shops with Bad Espresso Puck Prep,If people like myself who can dish out drinks faster with outstandingly better quality than two baby baristas were given respectable compensation for experience instead of minimum wage (even for senior barista roles like management are scant above) then perhaps youd see much better quality in the industry.  The fact remains that a lot of people leave or stop caring.  By the sheer amount of people who work in coffee logically there should be many skillful people but they all leave and I personally know many who have.  Businesses prefer baby baristas because they pay veterans like baby baristas.  EDIT: Im not even exaggerating on the speed or quality.  I have been in situations where Ive watched two people make coffee extremely slowly in a cumbersome manner many times because they dont have years of experience or training behind their belt.  So quite literally myself and others do eliminate the cost of one other person.  Give people a good raise.

I do want to disagree with a lot of the ’time is money’ sentiment in here.

From what Ive seen all the fancy prep stuff - OCD WDT and so on can get you a consistency of TDS thats about 1 - 2% more consistent. Thats means you can get say exactly 20% +-0.1% by doing all the stuff while just tamping will give you something like 20% +-1% (assuming your goal is 20% as an example).

i43as7v,2022-04-09 15:32:39,coffeechestpains,tzx5os,Coffees Shops with Bad Espresso Puck Prep,I have recently owned a cafe that made 800-1000 cups a day on the weekend 600-700 per day during the week. I got burnt out by the relentlessness of this and didnt want to trust it to someone else to run so i sold it.   When i took over the cafe they were doing 1/3rd of that. You want to know how to make money in the coffee game? Sell consistently above average quality in a speedy time. You are selling a legal addictive drug. If you do it right it is a license to print money.   Now for fun i am a barista trainer for a great local roastery. I have done on average 200 to 300 training sessions per year for the last 3 years  The best way to get consistently delicious coffee is to ensure your shot pours evenly and that needs a clean dry and hot basket filter with the grounds settled evenly to reduce the chance of channelling. Flush your group head wipe the basket dose settle tamp and pull.

If a shop is calling itself “specialty” that’s the minimum they should be doing otherwise they are not being trained properly and not being run properly.

i43ksdc,2022-04-09 16:49:07,EffecterFly13159,tzx5os,Coffees Shops with Bad Espresso Puck Prep,I agree with you here. Work in a cafe similar to the one you describe and we follow the procedure you’ve outlined ALWAYS distributing and tamping grounds. The .5 seconds it takes are worth it for the quality. We consistently get people coming in and talking about how our espresso is better than all the other shops in town to the point that I got curious and started checking those places out - I noticed a lot of sloppy technique. Plus if you’re a good barista you get into such a flow pulling shots that the extra time it takes is negligible you can still crank out that volume. People are generally fine waiting an extra minute or two for quality.,i43as7v,/r/Coffee/comments/tzx5os/coffees_shops_with_bad_espresso_puck_prep/i43ksdc/'

Of course you need to flush wipe your basket ect. Im saying what a lot of people do at home and what I think OP is saying - it doesnt make sense for a cafe to use RTD and WDT and the likes in a cafe environment where its not necessary. Using a good commercial grinder and weighing your doses (ontop of what you have just said) is the basis of a good specialty shop.   A shop that doesnt wipe baskets doesnt weigh doses and doesnt flush between shots wont produce good coffee.,i43as7v,/r/Coffee/comments/tzx5os/coffees_shops_with_bad_espresso_puck_prep/i44ucck/'

i410oqi,2022-04-09 05:44:15,tjtoed,tzs0ka,Less bitter V60 without bloom?,This would imply you were over extracting your bloomed pour overs. My guess is you are grinding too fine.

i40yty7,2022-04-09 05:26:37,chigoku,tzs0ka,Less bitter V60 without bloom?,The bloom phase helps to increase extraction.

i439gdg,2022-04-09 15:22:40,Vernicious,tzs0ka,Less bitter V60 without bloom?,The bloom phase can do a couple of things -- one of the big ones is to prevent channeling.  As CO2 gets released the bubbles absolutely create a channel.  As with any channel water will preferentially flow through it over-extracting the grinds that border the channel (this will more often result in astringency or dryness than bitterness) and the surrounding grinds that see less water will be relatively underextracted (this results in sourness).  If your beans dont have much CO2 left you wont get enough bubbles to cause channels.  If you poured all your water and then just swirled if the channels were small that might have been enough.  Two reasons that a bloom might not have resulted in an improvement.  That at least is the theory.  As it turns out theres lots of ways to make great coffee.  I always find it ironic that both Chad Wangs and James Hoffmans techniques work amazing for me even though theyre opposites in many ways.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tzs0ka/less_bitter_v60_without_bloom/i439gdg/'
i49m55r,2022-04-11 00:32:39,rnmennell,tzs0ka,Less bitter V60 without bloom?,Sounds like your grinds are too fine. Id suggest a coarser grind and a v60 journal if youre going to experiment.  Coffee shouldnt be \*bitter\* but it should be slightly acidic or astringent on the tongue that washes away when the other notes express and leaves a sweet sensation(it isnt sweet but it feels like it is).  If youre not getting that you might be grinding wrong if your water temp is at an appropriate place to not destroy the flavonoid youre chasing in the coffee you got.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tzs0ka/less_bitter_v60_without_bloom/i49m55r/'

All those things will affect how effective the blooming phase is.   1:18 is on the weaker side btw.

i43idab,2022-04-09 16:30:27,BubbleSmith,tzs0ka,Less bitter V60 without bloom?,If anything CO2 would make it more sour. Im off the opinion that the bloom also helps a lot with properly wetting the grinds (which helps with flow and avoiding pockets of dry coffee) and preheating. Both of these things will help with extraction so it tracks with the bloom increasing extraction.

Among the reasons for the bloom is to prevent the CO2 release from creating channels -- which absolutely happen in pourovers and can impact flavor quite a bit.

i44jsi5,2022-04-09 21:42:19,RaisedByHoneyBadgers,tzs0ka,Less bitter V60 without bloom?,I watched this whole thing. I intuitively do almost everything he describes here when preparing in a funnel but:  1) I think a filter paper that doesn’t properly fit the funnel is better. Why? Because you get better flow through the entire filter paper.  2) I find it’s just as good or better to “brew” in a measuring cup or other vessel and stir lightly until the gas is gone. Then I allow the grounds to settle and pour through the funnel/filter. I time the whole process to approximately 3 minutes (meaning the final filtration is finished between 3-4 minutes).  Also I make sure to use a filter paper that doesn’t show pinpricks of light.  My grind is slightly less than 1mm average.  No blooming no special pouring or stirring.

It’s been spitting coffee grounds everywhere and the basket will overflow if I try and brew a full pot.  I’ve descaled 3 times and tried different filters and grind sizes.  If anyone has any suggestions on how else to fix it I’m open to try it before replacing otherwise I need a new one.  I do have a Breville Espresso machine for when I want something fancier so the Ninja frother and “espresso” settings go unused which seems like a waste and is why I’m not necessarily looking to buy the same thing to replace it.    If I need a new machine I’m fine with investing a bit (<300) if it’s good quality and I’ll get better tasting coffee out of it. Ideally I’d like something that’s programmable can brew individual cups or a full carafe gets at or close to 205 degrees and the carafe and basket are dishwasher safe.

i455tzt,2022-04-10 01:52:12,Zarten,tzq2ua,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,It really comes down to how much effort you are willing to put in.  Everyone needs a scale and I recommend [this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenTour-Precision-Espresso-Back-Lit-Batteries/dp/B083PX1VHG/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=coffee+scale&qid=1649578616&sr=8-4) as a starter. Its really all you need and its only **$20**.  Next you need to determine if you want to grind your own coffee. I dont really recommend you get a hand grinder unless youre burning for money. Its tedious but its cheaper. However an electric grinder is loud and is more expensive. If you take care of it youll only need to buy it once until you decide you want an even better grinder. I recommend the **Baratza Encore**. Its about **$150-170** depending on where you look. Its ok if you decide you just want to buy pre-ground coffee. Dont let other people decide whats best for you. Pre-ground means less fresh and less tasty coffee but convenience is just too big to ignore for some people.  Lastly you need a way to make your coffee. I recommend looking into **French presses** as a beginner to coffee. Theyre easy to use but theyre a little annoying to clean because you have to take apart the filter to clean it every time. However its a great start to see if you really want to get into coffee. These could be anywhere from **$25-40**. You do need a kettle to boil water and I recommend you start with a **gooseneck kettle**. The long spout will help you control the water output and placement. This will run you around **$40** for a stove top kettle (non-electric).  I highly recommend you start down this path to see if you really are interested in coffee. This is the most economical and flexible way to elevate your coffee in the morning without committing too much time or money. You just have to figure out the best thing for you. Since you dont know much we can only give you very general suggestions but once you know we can give you better suggestions.  But this is where I would start. All together its about $200-300 for a starting kit using the above suggestions but you do need to find a coffee source. I recommend you look up coffee roasters near you and just order very small amounts from them to figure out what kind of coffee youre into. I would order .25 lbs (if they offer that quantity) or ask for samples. This will ensure that youre getting the freshest coffee. Buying coffee from grocery stores is a crapshoot. You have old beans beans that are covered in oils that will gunk up your machine and just worse quality beans in general. Order from a coffee roaster! Its the same price and it is more fresh.  *tldr* Buy a scale French press/ any method to make coffee and a gooseneck kettle. Figure out if you want to grind your own beans before buying a grinder. Find a source of fresh coffee and sample sample sample before committing to buying expensive beans.  Let me know if you have any questions. I will be happy to answer any.,i40z9ts,/r/Coffee/comments/tzq2ua/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i455tzt/'

Use filtered water. I have an RO undersink system but even water from a Brita-type filter will improve your coffee. 2. Heat your water to the right temperature (not boiling!) 3. Buy a burr grinder (last step for when youre ready to take that leap!)

i457ntx,2022-04-10 02:17:06,Zarten,tzq2ua,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Grinders are an investment so I would save for a better grinder. If you love coffee the grinder will save you time and money in the long run. You just have to get over the initial cost.  If youre hellbent on getting that grinder it will be a good starting point and it will be a lot better than a blade grinder.  I like the **[Hoffman French Press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8)**. You can also just try random recipes until you find one you like. There are so many different brewing recipes on this sub.  If you want to get more into fresh coffee call your local coffee roaster and ask for samples. Ask all the questions you want. The more information you give them the better they can give you something youd like. Dont buy pounds of coffee before you figure out what you want. Try to buy quarter pounds at a time if they offer that.,i452ie0,/r/Coffee/comments/tzq2ua/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i457ntx/'
i45h3fk,2022-04-10 04:24:32,MikeTheBlueCow,tzq2ua,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,That is a good grinder if that is what your budget allows. If you get more serious into coffee you will likely want to upgrade after you realize its limitations but its definitely good enough to start your new interest in coffee.  The French Press your already have is typically a great starting point. Other methods that are highly recommended would be something with a paper filter like the Clever Dripper or AeroPress that are both highly popular relatively inexpensive and are both similar-but-different to the French press. The AeroPress is more different since you can get increased flexibility in the style of brew and you can make a coffee concentrate with it a little more easily for like an espresso substitute if you want to try milk drinks. So if you can deal with the smaller single-serving size of the AeroPress I probably recommend that more. Other great options are the Moka pot if you really enjoy that metal/unfiltered taste of coffee. The next thing to try after those is a pour over though you generally benefit from having a gooseneck kettle for those and this increases the cost significantly.   As far as coffee suggestions there are three general roast levels light medium and dark. I would try a few of each to see what you like most (or if your like all three). They all have their own way to brew them best so look up some guides (or ask). If youre doing a light roast its worth checking out an African origin that promises fruity notes. Ethiopia is wildly popular. But mostly just try a variety of origins. We have a coffee suggestion thread every week that might be a good place to look if you dont really have much for local roasters.,i452ie0,/r/Coffee/comments/tzq2ua/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i45h3fk/'

i48r0y2,2022-04-10 19:10:57,acid-runner,tzq2ua,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,If you have a sink strainer the FP can be non-messy by rinsing the grinds in the strainer and dumping the strainer out. I dont wash mine every day just rinse and air dry (but that might be personal preference)  You also wouldnt need a gooseneck for it since how you pour doesnt matter its immersion based. Any kind of pour over you do would greatly benefit from it though. To me pour over looks hard to be consistent with and if youre just starting out Id recommend a French press as well.

Its actually pretty versatile and there are good and simple recipes. The Aeropress is also great and can be as simple or complex as youd like.   And yeah as others have suggested get a scale and electric kettle. My old kettle is pretty basic with some temp control. Ill upgrade at some point. For now Im deep into the espresso hole. That can get expensive so you may want to hold off before you fall into the abyss.   Glad you found a place to source coffee. There are quite a few in the UK so shop around.

V60 mostly clever Dripper sometimes—same for aeropress.   For v60 and Clever D also it’s usually 45g beans. No way that fits in the hopper. Frequently it doesn’t fit in the catch cup either—sometimes you can squeeze it in and you feel the grounds packing in against the lower bearing becoming hard to turn.   Espresso just as easy.

i40p0zk,2022-04-09 03:34:34,Kuang_Grade_Mark_II,tzovd4,On a search for a specific coffee machine,I never knew there are built in coffee machines really interesting.    Considering the coffee in a nespresso is prepared in a very specific way it’s not really compatible with „regular“ coffee (beans or pre ground) unlike for example the senseo.   There are tastier ways to prepare coffee with different but they require some trial and error.    If you just want a quick and consistent way of preparing tasty coffee a high quality all in one machine is your best bet. They’re more expensive than a nespresso machine but they are cheaper in the long run because the coffee can be cheaper. You just need to sacrifice half a bag of coffee to dial in temperature and grind size. And I recommend buying better coffee that pays huge dividends and will consistently taste better than nespresso.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tzovd4/on_a_search_for_a_specific_coffee_machine/i40p0zk/'

i40fo9i,2022-04-09 01:27:59,BubbleSmith,tznuah,Experience with single dose grinders (e.g. Niche DF64 Oro Ode),I currently use a ROK grinder for multiple brew methods but Im not going to recommend it. Its very consistent and good value for money but adjusting it is a pain so I dont like to change grind size too often.  I was looking at the Fellow Ode as an upgrade but got tired of waiting for them to update and dont trust that Id be getting the newer version here in the UK. A friend pointed me to the Lagom Mini which I now have on order arriving next Month.  I cant comment on my experience with the Lagom Mini yet but it seems to handle coarser grinds very well but still be able to manage espresso. Kyle Rowsell does a good video comparing these two.  https://youtu.be/qyNJ13cbtXA,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tznuah/experience_with_single_dose_grinders_eg_niche/i40fo9i/'
i40j3s9,2022-04-09 02:14:25,esperalegant,tznuah,Experience with single dose grinders (e.g. Niche DF64 Oro Ode),I got a Specialita a few weeks ago. I know its not technically a single dose but the retention is really low - probably less than 1g so its close enough. And there are single dose mods you could try. I thought Id want to try them but so far I dont see any need. On the other side if I do want to grind 200g for cold brew or something then I can do that too. Not sure if thats easy for single dose grinders.   The grind quality is amazing and it works fine for espresso up to pour over size. The speed is great - people mention around 2-3g/s and that seems about right to me.   The noise level is also great. I hate noise in my kitchen and this was what really sold it for me. This would never interrupt a conversation or anything.. Build quality is also great it just feels solid and well made.   Negatives: so far theres only one really. But it is quite a big one although I wouldnt say its quite a deal breaker. Adjusting the grind size is not fun. Tiny micro adjustments are easy but if you wanna switch from espresso to pour over then back you need to turn the tiny wheel about 2 or 3 full rotations. Then its really hard to find your previous location and unless you have way better memory than me or keep a tiny book or something youll basically need to dial in the espresso all over again.   Its the one thing where when I look at the big wheel on the Niche it makes me wish I had got that instead. I feel like the Niche is designed for experimenting with different beans and brewing methods while the Specialita is more of a traditional cafe style set mindset where you dial in a particular bean for espresso and then you dont adjust the grind setting again for a while. On the other hand the Niche is something like twice the price where I am - I could buy a full size commercial grinder for the same price as the Niche.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tznuah/experience_with_single_dose_grinders_eg_niche/i40j3s9/'

Going SJ to DF64 to address retention your workflow will be the same as adding bellows to SJ.  BUT you then have to deal with the DF64 static issues/RDT and aligning it.  Choice is yours but if youre considering DF64 simply to address retention youre paying >$300 to address a <$30 problem.  If you want to improve quality of v60 and syphon I personally would spend that change on SSP burrs the improvement in cup for filter over these espresso burrs youre looking at is noticable.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tznuah/experience_with_single_dose_grinders_eg_niche/i44y4u0/'

i40ktdh,2022-04-09 02:37:46,BubbleSmith,tznuah,Experience with single dose grinders (e.g. Niche DF64 Oro Ode),Theres a big update to the burrs due soon. Theyve been teasing for like 9 months though.  Theyve already updated the burrs once. Theyve also said that existing owners will be able to buy new burrs at a deep discount but Im not confident thatll be available outside the US due to their distribution model. Ive seen scattered reports of issues with calibration and other bits which put me off in the end.  Many seem to upgrade with SSP burrs but that seems like throwing a lot of money (and wasting what you spent on the included burrs) to fix something Fellow should be sorting with the units themselves.

i40iyep,2022-04-09 02:12:23,staemdeck,tznuah,Experience with single dose grinders (e.g. Niche DF64 Oro Ode),They charge same amount for the grinder for non UK customers as they do for UK customers. But the price for UK customers includes the VAT 20% paid to the government. VAT is tax ONLY applicable to UK residents. No one else should pay that. So if you are american you basically paid 20% more for no reason. Even worse if you are european you will pay additional (about) 20% above the price because you have to pay local VAT atop from UK VAT.   There are two scenarios what happens though. Either niche is a true scum and they actually correctly apply forms and get 20% VAT back from UK (which is what they should be doing when they are exporting) thus basically pocketing extra cash or they are lazy to do that (really easy thing to do) and just dont care that people are getting ripped off.,i40ij24,/r/Coffee/comments/tznuah/experience_with_single_dose_grinders_eg_niche/i40iyep/'

Otherwise I suspect DF64 bellows would fit and can be sourced from Ali Express.   I get retention within margin of measurement error I.e.: 0.1g  Do you want to gain aesthetics? Or something else?  I doubt a DF64 italmil standard burrs will be better than new standard burrs for your SJ.   The DF64 needs alignment effort from my experienced measuring runout on mazzers they don’t.   Both grinders benefit from SSP.   Without the ridiculous SJ hopper and tray here’s the dimensions compared.

i44xee5,2022-04-10 00:02:54,EarwaxUK,tznuah,Experience with single dose grinders (e.g. Niche DF64 Oro Ode),The thing Im looking to improve is the workflow rather than the quality of grind. Getting everything out of the SJ is quite a lot of work.  As an example if I put 20g into the Jolly I get between 5-7g out. I can get the rest out but it requires quite a lot of effort. For example in the neck of the SJ there are flat sections that the hopper would have rested on and these hold beans and popcorned fragments of beans so I have to brush these into the burrs. The burrs retain (based on my measurements) somewhere between 2 and 5 grams of grounds (dependant on bean type grind setting etc) so I blow those out. And I find that as much as 80% of my dose sits in the chute and doesnt fall out on its own so I end up tilting the grinder to get that out and using a brush poked up the front of the grinder to sweep it out.  Something like the Niche seems to solve these issues. Many people still seem to use bellows on it but Ive no idea exactly how much they gain from that. What theyre seemingly not doing is tilting banging manually feeding and sweeping out with a brush.  I think my concern is that the SJ is a better or more consistent grinder than any of the single dosers meaning I could improve the workflow but at the cost of quality in my V60 or syphon,i43vmdr,/r/Coffee/comments/tznuah/experience_with_single_dose_grinders_eg_niche/i44xee5/'
i42z8ni,2022-04-09 14:07:57,EarwaxUK,tznuah,Experience with single dose grinders (e.g. Niche DF64 Oro Ode),I think I could see this argument from a geometry perspective but it still doesnt make much sense to me.  Im using an entirely espresso focused grinder at the moment but it has flat burrs. If fines are beneficial in espresso and conical burrs produce more fines why do most commercial espresso grinders have flat burrs?  Im really interested in this because perhaps the only thing that puts my off the niche is the fact that the burrs are different to my current grinder. Theres so much noise all over the Internet about how flat burrs are better for one thing and conical better for another but I dont have the opportunity to test this for myself. How big really is that difference?,i41bu83,/r/Coffee/comments/tznuah/experience_with_single_dose_grinders_eg_niche/i42z8ni/'

BUT you then have to deal with the DF64 static issues/RDT and aligning it.  &#x200B  Choice is yours but if youre considering DF64 simply to address retention youre paying >$300 to address a <$30 problem. If you want to improve quality in v60 and syphon I personally would spend that change on SSP burrs the improvement in cup for filter over these espresso burrs youre looking at is huge.,i44xee5,/r/Coffee/comments/tznuah/experience_with_single_dose_grinders_eg_niche/i44y22v/'
i439z2n,2022-04-09 15:26:33,MikeTheBlueCow,tznuah,Experience with single dose grinders (e.g. Niche DF64 Oro Ode),Even with flat burrs the designs of the burrs vary such that some are for espresso and others are for brew. Flat burr does not automatically mean less fines until you look at the burr design itself. Same with conical burrs- youll even hear about an improvement when burrs get larger however I had smaller conical burrs in a hand grinder that were better designed for brew than the larger conical burrs in the Niche.  How big the difference is may depend on your palate. I might not say its a huge difference but it is detectable and enough so that I would use my hand grinder instead of the Niche for pour over and later for a df64 to play that role.,i42z8ni,/r/Coffee/comments/tznuah/experience_with_single_dose_grinders_eg_niche/i439z2n/'

Your grinder might be low quality and produce chunks and fines but my best way of getting good cups from “worse” grinders is go a little bit courser and opt for a brewing method that agitates the coffee more maybe a slow fill with u stirring the slurry or with a variant of 4:6 multiple short pours.

i4o84ye,2022-04-14 00:16:00,balki_123,tzltym,Follow up: thoughts on the long aeropress immersion method?,With aeropress especially with this long steeping method you get absolutely different taste profile than with V60 (for example). Its like comparing hammer to shovel.  I have coffees that are absolutely watery when done with V60 and excellent with aeropress. And I have coffees which are just OK when done with aeropress and heavenly tasting when made by V60.  Its not a rule but aeropress works better with cocoa and nutty tasting cofees while V60 is better for fruity coffees.

i3ylvjx,2022-04-08 15:23:23,LickableLeo,tzdz2d,Grind settings,Hello no specific recommendations but when I got an Encore grinder for my Moccamaster they gave a ranger of grind sizes in the instructions. I started in the middle (notch 20 on the encore) and brewed pots up and down in both directions until I found the setting I like best.   As the grind became too fine the coffee became progressively more bitter and at a certain point the machine would overflow from too fine grinds clogging up in the basket (<15). Then I went up and up more coarse until the coffee became weak and lacked flavor (>30).  Okay tasting coffee comes across a large part of the range (15-25) great tasting coffee comes from a small part of the range (18-22) this fine tuning is needed. This will also depend on the machine you use.   Achieving a happy medium (21) took me a while but once I found it Ive been able to leave it with good results. Very flavorful and consistent without becoming too bitter or causing the machine to overflow. Finding the right setting will unlock a ton of great flavor in your coffee so experimentation with the grind size is well worth the work and tragedy of an overflow event.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tzdz2d/grind_settings/i3ylvjx/'

i3wt2jm,2022-04-08 08:21:26,reviews_coffee,tz5hyr,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,Three new coffees this week  [Deiro Garcia anaerobic washed processed Colombia](https://manhattancoffeeroasters.com/catalog/coffee/deiro-garcia-1) from Manhattan Coffee Roasters out of Rotterdam Netherlands. Very reminiscent of a lively floral pink lemonade for me with such an abundance of strong red berries. Very sweet but relatively clean in general for the processing method.  [Jasper CM Lot 142 Carbonic Macertaion natural processed Kenya](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/kenya-maguta-jasper-lot-142-cm-natural-100g) from Rogue Wave out of Edmonton Alberta. First time trying Rogue Wave and knew what I was getting myself into this one. Its what youd imagine from a heavily processed Kenyan coffee as it was a bit of an intense red fruit experience skewing heavily in the overbearing sense.  [MeiZi washed China](https://blendincoffeeclub.com/product/meizi-washed/) from BlendIn Coffee Club out of Sugar Land Texas. First time trying a Chinese coffee and it was okay. A lot of people have strong feelings on the catimor variety in general and I felt it was heavily in play as the coffee just felt lacking in quality. Not all bad there was some slight burnt sugar sweetness but it was mostly highlighted by a strong smokiness dominating the cup.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i3wt2jm/'
i3x6jid,2022-04-08 09:46:48,Disguised_Riches,tz5hyr,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,Tried three different coffees this week. One of the coffees was brewed at home one was tasted at a friends coffee shop and one was tasted both at the friends coffee shop and brewed at home.  &#x200B  [Rogue Wave Gesha Village Lot RSV.7](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/ethiopia-gesha-village-lot-rsv-7-aerobic-natural-gori-gesha-150g) :  Another delicious auction lot coffee from u/RogueWaveCoffee out of Edmonton Canada.  This is a natural processed Gori Geisha (idk the difference between Gori Geisha and regular Geisha). The official tasting notes list notes of Strawberry Jam Tangerine Grape Vanilla Chocolate and Ginger Candy. I am unable to taste all the tasting notes at once but on separate occasions have caught notes of Strawberry Jam and Ginger Candy  (never together always separately). A consistent note that that I do get from this coffee is chocolate and some vanilla-like sweetness.  &#x200B  Apollons Gold Janson Los Alpes for BOP : This is a washed Geisha from the famed Panamanian producer Janson Coffee roasted by Apollons Gold out of Tokyo Japan. Apollons Golds coffees have a very long degassing time so I did not open my bag yet but did have a friend who owns a coffee shop brew some of his for me. I have not tried many washed geishas before so the brightness of the acidity found in this coffee shocked me when I first tried it. The tasting notes that I got from this coffee were strong notes of yellow lemon and a slight yuzu sauce taste. The yellow lemon note matches what Appolons Gold lists but the yuzu sauce taste was not listed. Looking forward to brewing this coffee at home once my bag has finished degassing.  &#x200B  [Coffee Collective Daterra Our Plot Geisha](https://coffeecollective.dk/shop/our-plot-geisha/) : TBH I asked my friend who owns a coffee shop to procure this Geisha for me mainly because of the rarity of the coffee. Limited to 75 bags in total and produced in Brazil at an altitude of 1150 MASL this coffee is unique in the sense that only Coffee Collective will ever carry it and it is produced at a relatively low sea level for specialty Geisha. Tried it both at my friends coffee shop and brewed at home this coffee was not as good as I expected. Tasted in the coffee shop I got strong notes almond accompanied by mild fruity notes of yellow peach. There is barely any acidity to this coffee especially when tastes side-by-side with the washed Janson. Brewed at home this coffee produces a very mellow cup that is enjoyable but no mind-blowing. Maybe Geisha needs to be produced at super high altitudes to shine.  &#x200B  For next week I finishing up my bag of Coffee Collective Geisha but am looking forward to the arrival of  [Ona Coffee Finca Sophia Lot FSG W007](https://onacoffee.com.au/products/filter-reserve-option-2-m1) and brewing the Apollons Gold Janson at home.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i3x6jid/'
i3x6bxc,2022-04-08 09:45:28,Bloomit-19,tz5hyr,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,[Passenger Worka Chelbessa 2020](https://www.passengercoffee.com/products/passenger-archival-release-22-03-10-22): This is a “freezer Friday” release from Passenger where they roast a small amount of coffee put aside from past releases. I feel like I lucked out buying this one because this is an insanely good coffee.   Strong and pleasant floral aroma. Huge sweetness. Layered and complex acidity mainly citrus but just incredibly full of juicy flavors. A little bit of that savory-sweet tea characteristic Ethiopians tend to have though the most distinct thing about the coffee is how the acidity hits you in the face full of intense flavors balanced by a ton of sweetness.   This is easily one of the best coffees I’ve had and makes other washed Ethiopians in my recent memory seem dull. There’s just so much going on in the cup and it’s immensely enjoyable. If they released this again I’d grab multiple bags I don’t care what the price is.   [Phoenix Koji Process Caturra](https://phoenixcoffee.com/shop/exposures-2022-series-1-kojil): I had been meaning to order this coffee after reading [C Feran’s article ](https://christopherferan.com/2021/10/23/coffee-koji-and-kaapos-wbc-routine/) about using Koji spores during coffee processing and finally got it delivered this week. It’s a very enjoyable coffee definitely lives up to the hype.   The beans smelled strongly like berries or strawberry jam. Dominant flavors in the cup are sweet-savory tea (more on the sweet side) and cooked strawberry. Acidity is clean and crisp. Mouthfeel and texture hint at this being natural but if having this blind I’d guess something closer to washed process based on what I taste in the cup. This coffee reminds me of Tim Wendelboe Kiahia quite a bit especially with its long aftertaste and the sort of sweetness it has. I really enjoy the flavor I’m describing as sweet-savory tea some of my all time favorite coffees have it so this coffee hits the spot for me.   [Passenger Worka Chelbessa Natural](https://www.passengercoffee.com/products/worka-chelbessa-dry-process-2021): My first natural Ethiopian in a while. I enjoyed this though it’s hard comparing it to the exceptional coffees I listed above.   The coffee is quite gentle a lot like a washed Ethiopian. Med-low sweetness. Long and clean aftertaste. No hints of dirt booze nor rotten fruit as found in many natural process coffees. Acidity is hard to pin down but has some fresh fruit qualities rather than the usual berry-jam sort of cooked fruit flavors found in naturals. I’d say it’s closest to peach and on espresso I managed to make it somewhat tart.  Unlike the roaster’s description I got minimal aroma and no blueberries from this coffee. I think the description of “raspberry and black cherry” could be how they describe the tartness and stone fruit flavors I found in the cup.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i3x6bxc/'
i3xd3nf,2022-04-08 10:27:40,Coconut-Scholar,tz5hyr,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,[Fuglen Los Tongos Washed Pacas Honduras](https://www.fuglencoffee.no/products/los-tongos-washed-honduras-250g): Best way I can describe it is honey BBQ sauce. Very smoky without a trace of bitterness and tons of sweetness. Wouldn’t want to drink it all the time but has been a nice change of pace.  [Kawa (France) El Paraiso #1 Double Anaerobic Fermentation Castillo Colombia](https://shop.kawa.coffee/en/produit/colombie-el-paraiso-lot-1/): Same artificial peach flavour youd expect from this particular processing method and farm which is to say highly enjoyable and super sweet. A carbon copy of El Paraíso Lychee from Hatch but at a lower price point.   [Kawa (France) Shantawene Anaerobic Kurume Ethiopia](https://shop.kawa.coffee/en/produit/ethiopie-shantawene-anaerobie/): Sort of an accidental purchase but ended up loving this one. The smell was very boozy which was initially off-putting but I actually really enjoyed the deep fruity flavours. Tasted like a sweet berry compote.

i3yezm7,2022-04-08 14:35:21,andrew3stacks,tz5hyr,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,[Ninety Plus Reserve Lot mini pack - Lychello](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/rogue-wave-coffee-x-ninety-plus-reserved-lot-mini-pack?variant=39320180555827) from Rogue Wave: Some background first. They have four mini packs you can buy each a different processing method of a Panamanian Gesha from Ninety Plus Estate (this is more detailed on their website of course). They roast these using a smaller roaster and aim for 50g batches then remove roast defects leaving 40-45g for the buyer. I was fortunate enough to get on the higher end of that (44.5g yes I measured). I purchased the Lychello as it seemed closest to a standard washed Gesha and was one of the cheapest options.  The Lychello has a humongous depth of flavor. The primary tasting note (for me) is lemonade. This is the best “imitation of lemonade” I think I’ve had in a coffee even in the mouthfeel it’s like you’re drinking lemonade rather than coffee. You get chamomile on the back of your tongue and even slight confectionary sweetness in the cup. The flavors aren’t really in your face. It’s a more complex cup which I sometimes appreciate and enjoy more. It’s the coffee I’ve enjoyed the most since I tried Letty Bermudez last fall.  I’ve been doing just fine with 4 minute drawdown times at a 16.67 or 17/1 ratio on the V60.  [Panama Finca Carmen | Caturra Washed](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/panama-carmen-estate-caturra-washed) also from Rogue Wave: I haven’t quite gotten the best out of this coffee yet. On my first brew I made the error of dialing in a more developed roast on my normal temp (204 deg but depends on the roaster sometimes) and it was a tad roasty with some grapefruit acidity but was otherwise rather muted. I went down to the recommended 90 degrees Celsius and it’s better now. I think I could push the temperature a little higher because I think there’s a lot in the coffee I’m not getting but I have gotten flashes of pleasant stone fruit notes and a honeyed sweetness. Regardless this will be a fun one to experiment with. I also haven’t brewed it on the V60 yet which is the brew method I generally prefer.   Really is a good coffee (probably better than I’m saying it is) that I need to work on some more.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i3yezm7/'

A yellow honey CO2 processed Colombian gesha from one of the Santuario project farms in Cauca. Cupping notes describe floral citrus and red cherry. Ive been getting the floral and citrus notes out of the V60 using the Hoffmann method but also tasting something like ginger and lemongrass. Very nice coffee.  A gold washed red bourbon also from one of the Santuario project farms in Cauca. Cupping notes describe sweet citrus floral tropical and syrupy.  A purple honey processed bourbon from one of the Santuario project farms in Ixhuatlan Mexico. Cupping notes describe candied orange cranberries and nectarine.  A purple honey processed pink bourbon produced by Edwin Noreña. Cupping notes describe mandarin blueberries and dried cranberries.

i3wz4p5,2022-04-08 08:59:55,geggsy,tz5hyr,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,Two coffees from /u/RogueWaveCoffee in Edmonton Canada:  First up [a washed Caturra from Finca Carmen in Panama](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/panama-carmen-estate-caturra-washed).  If you told me this was an exceptional washed Ethiopian I would believe you as it has that strong sweet apricot tasting-note that I have enjoyed from many Ethiopian coffees this past season.  However it offers more than many of those coffees as it also has an underlying base note to the flavor profile that anchors the brighter fruity sweetness.  It is a bit like a symphony where theres high violins playing a melody with a low double bass below.  Alas I dont know how to describe that base note other than that - I cant put a tasting note to it and I dont identify the advertised notes of nectarine grapefruit honey white grape or chamomile.  Whether or not I can identify the notes though this is delicious!  Secondly is a [honey-processed Parainema from the Don Andres farm in Honduras](https://www.roguewavecoffee.ca/collections/coffee/products/honduras-isaias-fernandez-parainema-honey).  I tend to like coffees with citrus tasting notes and avoid coffees with nutty tasting notes.  So I was intrigued to buy and try this one that has both citrus-tasting notes (tangy and lime candy) as well as a nutty tasting note (Almond).  While the Parainema beans are beautifully large and uniform in their oval shape I didnt love how this tasted in the cup (I guess the nutty notes won over the citrus-y ones?).  While I can definitely dial it in to bring more bright acidity to the cup this wasnt my favourite.  That said I think this is a preference thing and I could definitely see others enjoying this one.  That said Im still going to finish the bag which is more than I can say for a particularly sharp and unappealing anaerobic I wrote about a month or so ago....,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i3wz4p5/'

i3yap03,2022-04-08 14:06:15,Whaaaooo,tz5hyr,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,Ive been drinking two new coffees both brewed on either the Aeropress (1:18) or the Tricolate (1:20):  **Kiangoi Kenya from Coffee Collective**: This one has been ok. There is great potential with all of its grapefruit characteristics but the roast is off. Tastes like it was tipped in the roast (from what I undestand meaning that excessive heat was applied post-first crack) which has resulted in a very roast-y finish.   **Finca Betel Colombia Natural Pink Bourbon from Regalia**: This one has also been just ok. Im not getting much more from it other than unpleasant (to me) natural funk. It definitely has a ton more natural characteristics than I was expecting surprising because Regalia typically selects natural coffees that are very similar to washed ones.  Hopefully Ill have more luck with my next set of coffees!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i3yap03/'

This is especially airy and tea-like with a very light citric quality even by the normal standards of geshas and Manhattan have roasted this quite light. Slight umami quality as well though not as much as koji coffees currently being offered by other roasters.  Highbank Edwin Norena Sidra - Another specially fermented coffee by Edwin Norena in Quindio Colombia whose gold washed pink bourbon offered by Vibrant was very popular last year. This coffee has a similar flavor profile though the flavor characteristics of sidra do come through the processing isn’t completely drowning them out (even if the processing is strong). This has a lavender ginger ale sparkling sweetness really nice if you like sweet anaerobically processed coffees (and in this case I really do).  [Onyx Colombia Luis Ramirez](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/colombia-luis-ramirez) \- Washed coffee from Narino this is one of the more traditionally roasted coffees I’ve had from Onyx in a while. I usually enjoy the more hearty sweetness of their coffees as a starter in the morning and to serve to others but this coffee has more roast in the flavor than I’m used to from them had to bring the temp down to 195-197.

Maybe just hints of underextraction by me though — Im new to tasting/brewing  I wanted to support something local-ish so I drove to my nearest city and and there was a Guest Roast (which I guess just means the café was selling other roasters beans alongside their own branded bags?) the barista recommend. The beans are from Guatemala and are said to have honey notes which I thought sounded interesting. Not entirely sure how light/dark the roast is as the bag doesnt say but Im excited to experiment with it. From icafe here in the UK if anyone happens to have tried them,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i3ygm2z/'
i41lmjf,2022-04-09 08:24:28,Alps-Resident,tz5hyr,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,Two new ones from Black and White this month.  Carlos Plazas - Cinnamon Anaerobic - Columbia  First time trying this processing style and not entirely sure I approve but my wife loves it so likely will be buying again. Tastes like a cinnamon-forward mulled cider with a big spoonful of demerara sugar. Some funkiness comes out as the cup cools and lower ratios lend flavors of cinnamon roll and raisin toast. Makes a tasty espresso.   Olman Pineda - Pacamara - Honduras  This has been a pleasant surprise. Stewed plums blackcurrant and herby berries with a bright tangerine note. Crisp acidity with full mouthfeel. This is billed as Kenyan-like and it certainly fits although the savory Pacamara character comes through in some cups.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz5hyr/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i41lmjf/'

I tried the Costa Rica Rainforest A1.  In general the comments are not that positive just general. I chose to try it out yup was thin and not that impressive. I normally age the beans seven days before using. After trying this guy again from my batch 2-3 weeks later it was much better it had a fuller flavour and had a slight coco aftertaste. So this guy needs more ageing for the flavour to come out.  I have five pounds so not disappointed in it anymore just makes sure aged at least two weeks before use.

I think that the more you roll it around over your tongue the more notes you find. It complex bright but soft. I am so happy you enjoy it.   For the Finca Carmen we do like it around 90-92c. You can also agitate slightly bit more with lower temp to push out some notes. A modified Tetsu 4:6 method also works well in the V60 (last 60% into 2x pour).

i3x1gow,2022-04-08 09:14:48,MikeTheBlueCow,tz42w7,Unsatisfying smell during brewing with Chemex question,Honestly the only time a brew smells good to me is the bloom. After that its very much not that great coffee smell. So you may not be able to improve on this the way you hope.   I honestly think the smell of coffee somehow manages to fill a room without being that strong as my wife will come into the kitchen and say that smells so good! without me even really smelling it much. Your nose gets used to a scent so you could maybe try the trick of smelling something neutral and then be able to smell the coffee again more strongly after cleansing your olfactory palate. Maybe there are other ways to trap the coffee smell by say brewing in more of a nook so the air gets trapped in the immediate area... But obviously thats not as easy to accomplish.  Another thing might be a hotter brewing temperature and more agitation. But thats going to affect the taste of your coffee so probably just not worth it.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz42w7/unsatisfying_smell_during_brewing_with_chemex/i3x1gow/'

i3whcl8,2022-04-08 07:05:29,boymeetsbeans,tz42w7,Unsatisfying smell during brewing with Chemex question,I guess I experience the same thing but I attribute it to the fact that all I am smelling is the grounds that are at the top of the slurry which are the least saturated by nature. I don’t think you can change this but someone may prove me wrong.  One note I’ll make is that your brew ratio of 1:18 is rather weak. I have two recipes for how much coffee I want (just me or me+wife): 44:700 and 32:500. Both are just about ok the nose for a 1:16 ratio. The furthest I stretch a chemex brew out to is 1:17.

i3yndm9,2022-04-08 15:34:08,lililliwilli,tz42w7,Unsatisfying smell during brewing with Chemex question,I’ve had the same thought about chemex brews for the 7-8 years I’ve been using it. Just something I’ve accepted when using the chemex. My auto drip machine has no issue with filling the house with a rich coffee aroma on the days I choose not to do a manual brew.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz42w7/unsatisfying_smell_during_brewing_with_chemex/i3yndm9/'
i40rbpo,2022-04-09 04:04:06,Shteevie,tz42w7,Unsatisfying smell during brewing with Chemex question,The steam coming off the top of the chemex contains less dissolved solids than the drink you will eventually consume. that weak coffee steam is what you are smelling.  The brewed coffee is contained in the chemex and the vapors are not able to escape. So you cant small those until the brew is complete and you remove the cone and let those aromas out.  Compare this to the comment about the auto drip machine elsewhere in the thread - the basket is sealed away in the brew chamber and the finished coffee aroma can escape via the pour spout of the carafe [which is often heated furthering the evaporation of the brewed coffee]. So the smells that permeate the room will be those of stronger brewed coffee.  You could maybe put a saucer over the top of the chemex while brewing to trap the weak coffee aroma and not let it fill the room but this might be tricky when you agitate and you obvs wouldnt be able to watch the bed during draw down.  Also ignore those 1:16 militants. If your coffee is delicious and strong how you like it then stick to your recipe. If you prefer this ratio then you should drink what you like.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz42w7/unsatisfying_smell_during_brewing_with_chemex/i40rbpo/'
i413zrw,2022-04-09 06:13:40,playitagain_sammy,tz42w7,Unsatisfying smell during brewing with Chemex question,IMHO. V60 is way better than chemex. There I said it. Chemex looks cooler in Instagram but the filters drain to fast and are massively wasteful because they’re so big.   Having said that looking at your method I wouldn’t swirl. That creates a vortex in the grounds where you really want a flat bottom. Gently swish side to side one way then the same at 90 degrees before your drawdown.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz42w7/unsatisfying_smell_during_brewing_with_chemex/i413zrw/'
i3x8wql,2022-04-08 10:01:36,jonmitz,tz42w7,Unsatisfying smell during brewing with Chemex question,So it’s kinda weird to judge your coffee based on smell. I don’t really get that. Sounds a little too much in the deep end like “audiophiles” who spend $600 on small square pieces of wood to improve the sound in their room (one of my favorite scams I’ve ever seen).   However I can comment that you’re using a 1:20 / 1:21 ratio. You should first try to reduce that it’s a lot of water.  Most books on coffee suggest 1:16 or 1:17. You’re using almost 20% more water than the standard “ideal” ratio.   Like others have said the roast bean type and grind also matter. Bean quality also plays in a lot but depending where you live that may not be something you can do much about.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz42w7/unsatisfying_smell_during_brewing_with_chemex/i3x8wql/'

I use a setting of 10 on the encore+ for light to medium roasts which if fairly fine but doesn’t create an impenetrable mat of mud on top. And I brew at 60g/L. So 30 grams and 500 grams water. Which yields 440 grams of coffee. I use 2-3x as much water as grinds for the bloom which lasts 30 seconds. Then I add all of the rest of the water flatten the bottom and walk away until it’s finished dripping. Light to medium roasts should be brewed just off boil but dark roasts should be ground coarser and brewed with cooler water. 190f max.,i3xb9bz,/r/Coffee/comments/tz42w7/unsatisfying_smell_during_brewing_with_chemex/i415t48/'

i3w79pe,2022-04-08 05:52:52,Blind_Pierre,tz1rrb,Manual vs Electric grinder,Youre at end game hand grinder and hand grinders always punch above their price class in quality. Like another comment said you probably wouldnt get anything SUBSTANTIALLY better unless youre looking at 1k+.   That said electric grinders can be different. The differences are just minor and you wont be getting a huge difference in quality. More a difference in profile because you could try out flat burrs. I dont have time to research the differences to make this anything more than anecdotal but flat and conical burrs are typically thought of as producing different kinds of cups and highlight different parts of the coffee. You may love flat burrs but its in hair splitting territory.   So youre not missing any depth in your coffee sticking to the hand grinder but electric may offer some fun breadth in the coffee world.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz1rrb/manual_vs_electric_grinder/i3w79pe/'

I also think I can still improve my technique/puck prep for espresso etc and get more out of those improvements for free.  There is a local shop that sells eureka grinders and sometimes when the owner is around (very passionate guy) he does tastings with customers on different consumer grade espresso machines/grinders. maybe Ill get to taste the cheaper flat burr options this way.,i3w79pe,/r/Coffee/comments/tz1rrb/manual_vs_electric_grinder/i429srh/'

i3wblwk,2022-04-08 06:25:25,turbokimchi,tz1g2g,Reusable nespresso pods,Lot of downvotes here folks perhaps instead of focusing on how to brew coffee that’s less bitter you should be less bitter to other casual coffee enjoyers.

i3wbz5n,2022-04-08 06:28:08,Swissaliciouse,tz1g2g,Reusable nespresso pods,Depends on what you define as espresso. If you count any coffee extracted under suitable high pressures (6 - 12 bar) then nespresso is certainly espresso. If you also care about how much water you push through then it depends on the machine if you can achieve a suitable input-output ratio (e.g. a ristretto on a nespresso machine can be as low as 15 ml which is close to a 1:2 ratio).   The problem with the refillable pods are that they are quite small and only contain a fairly low amount of coffee - typically around 6 g. Modern recipes ask for much more. Also the options to dial in an espresso are very limited on a typical nespresso machine.   If you like the taste of your refillable nespresso - then go with it. If you want to experience the real espresso journey then there is no way around a decent portafilter machine.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tz1g2g/reusable_nespresso_pods/i3wbz5n/'

Their packaging technique does a great job preserving the coffee in the pods. I think their packaging method is patented and am not sure if the third party pods can get as fresh as the Nespresso branded ones.  There are kits for making your own pods you could try if that answers your question. The kit I saw had a plastic pod you put your coffee in and a pack of disposable adhesive foil lids to cap the pod with after you fill it.,i3w9mn1,/r/Coffee/comments/tz1g2g/reusable_nespresso_pods/i3wf2cc/'

i3wk91r,2022-04-08 07:24:43,Stevoman,tz1g2g,Reusable nespresso pods,Correct. That needle penetrates the pointed end of the pod. Hot water is injected into the pod via the needle. This builds pressure in the pod until the perforated foil lid ruptures. The pressurized hot water flows through the coffee grounds to brew espresso (pressurized hot water + coffee = espresso) which exits the capsule through the ruptured foil lid.,i3whxx2,/r/Coffee/comments/tz1g2g/reusable_nespresso_pods/i3wk91r/'

We drink espresso V60 and FrenchPress Coffee and are switching very frequently.  So I am looking for a good grinder for all three types of Coffee..  Currently I have a Sette 270 that I bought for that reason. For Espresso it is ok but for the other two it is not. It produces way to many fines.  What I want to have is: - Reliable grind size settings ( easy to go back and forth between different brew methods) - No Retention ( As I am switching frequently purging the other grind size would be to wasteful) - Good Performance for the different brew methods   I was looking at the Niche Zero but I found some posts that it is not usable for Pour-Over.

Also make sure your water tastes good on its own.

i3x2fl2,2022-04-08 09:20:55,sinisterbob,tz025d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Channelling in an aeropress is a bit weird because youre not really forcing water through a compacted bed of coffee like you would in an espresso. Its more like the coffee grounds are settling into a puck shape as the amount of water available for them to float around in is reduced as you plunge. Granted there will be a certain amount of water-passing-through-a-puck going on but by that point your extraction should be pretty much done so channelling should have a minimal (if any) effect. My guess is that the slightly disturbed filter didnt actually make much of a difference at all and you just got lucky with this particular brew.,i3wmetb,/r/Coffee/comments/tz025d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3x2fl2/'

Both of these can be easily bought in person from speciality coffee shops or online from many places.  On the other hand the Espro Bloom uses proprietary filters sold only through them.   I’d consider the V60 02 or Kalita Wave 185. The Origami looks pretty but isn’t as practical since it doesn’t have a handle and has such a narrow base that it’s easy to tip over. You also need to buy a separate base holder to rest it on a mug.   I have a Blue Bottle dripper that I enjoy using.

So youll end up having to adjust your dose once your grind is close enough in order to try to finish your dialing in. It also tends to have quite a bit of retention. Its pretty easy to pop out the top burr and vacuum/compressed air out as many of the retained grounds as possible and run the grinder for a while with no beans in it and whack the side a few times to knock as much as possible out of the chute.,i3xlp8c,/r/Coffee/comments/tz025d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3ygxtq/'

The coffee only has so much material to give up so you need to add more coffee to get more material into the same amount of water.

i3y54h3,2022-04-08 13:29:22,Chi_CoffeeDogLover,tz025d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I think more water would lighten the body of the coffee but it is a personal preference and the level of extraction you are looking for. If you think the body of the coffee tasted good but the flavor tasted a bit weak then you are resting with a coffee that displays those levels of enticement. You could consider increasing the amount of water used like Hoffman suggested and then increasing the length of steep time to help balance it out. Add 30 seconds.,i3xymvi,/r/Coffee/comments/tz025d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3y54h3/'

I dont think the ratio have an direct effect on the extraction it just changes the strength(coffee molecules to water) of the cup.   There are various ways to increase extraction other then the ones you listed you could also use a higher temperature or agitate abit more or a longer bloom.  My suggestion is to try to steep (30s) longer first as that is probably the least likely to overextract.,i3xymvi,/r/Coffee/comments/tz025d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3zkr4i/'
i3yghoj,2022-04-08 14:45:42,VibrantCoffee,tz025d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Id keep using your Sette 270 for espresso and buy a brew-focused grinder like a Vario-W+ or an Ode with SSP burrs. Even with essentially unlimited budget there really is not a grinder that absolutely excels at both espresso and brew. They just require slightly different grind distributions. Closest you can probably get is an EG1 if you can spend that kind of money. If you must only have one grinder and the budget is quite a bit lower than EG1 territory Id probably say Vario-W+ but really it isnt wonderful for traditional style espressos.

i3zbr83,2022-04-08 18:40:30,u_int16,tz025d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Thats probably a small amount of fines dislodging from your bed into the filter! Which would to some degree align with my experience.  Fellow support said to align the burrs and wait for them to break in in 5lbs of coffee. I dont fully understand burr seasoning and am choosing to trust Fellow on it.

i3zot85,2022-04-08 20:28:10,u_int16,tz025d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I think you might be onto something regarding seasoning.  I ground 100g just now and only produced \~30g of fines. Thats a significant improvement. Ill try to stick with it for a bit longer I hope to hit <5% fines. If that involves re-aligning and/or buying the SSP burrset... worth doing!  As for the brews now that I have the Kruve the fines are not a problem. I can just discard them.

I know channeling is a major challenge with espresso but isnt it also an issue with other brew methods even pour over?

i3yhkgo,2022-04-08 14:53:06,VibrantCoffee,tz025d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yes channeling is most definitely still an issue in pourovers and AeroPress brews.   As long as there was still mostly the same amount of coffee in the area where there was no paper filter as there was over the filter (maybe the grounds continuously moved as you pressed keeping the grounds more or less level at an ever decreasing depth) then you wouldnt really get any channeling assuming correct grind size good saturation of the grounds relatively few fines and slow plunging. I am not really sure if that is possible just spit-balling. But if it tasted good then maybe that is how it happened?,i3xtk6j,/r/Coffee/comments/tz025d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3yhkgo/'
i3xar9y,2022-04-08 10:13:10,lasdue,tz025d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,The filter itself doesn’t really care if the water is hot or cold but rather it depends on what material your V60 is. For a ceramic/glass one you’d want to use boiling water to also pre-heat the cone.

i3znnct,2022-04-08 20:18:05,bostoncreampuff,tz025d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I think the main reason to wet the filter is to get rid of the paper taste so if you dont taste the paper then everything is fair game even no prerinse.  One thing about using tap is water preasure(depends on your faucet).

i3y29os,2022-04-08 13:10:31,Horong,tyzq92,Coffee tonic appreciation and question,I think it might be worth trying to do it like an iced pour over.   Put tonic water in your pour over receptacle. Use more coffee than you normally would and brew with however much water you would normally use less the amount of tonic you have.   For example use 30g coffee and brew 300ml water with 200ml tonic to get a 500ml drink. I think its worth a try.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tyzq92/coffee_tonic_appreciation_and_question/i3y29os/'

A DE is just coffee and water so more water isn’t making much difference. The analogy comparing to alcohol I think is flawed. I believe you still get as drunk food would make a far bigger difference.

i3w5eec,2022-04-08 05:38:01,Gramernatzi,tyzccp,Water then espresso,Diluted alcohol does indeed not cause much of a difference in how drunk you get (and indeed similar to how I mentioned elsewhere it technically gets you drunk very slightly faster). Most people just tend to drink less alcohol if its diluted because their stomach ends up filling up faster and they usually drink less alcohol over the same amount of time. Eating food is the biggest contributor and will make you absorb both less quickly rather noticably.,i3w1f02,/r/Coffee/comments/tyzccp/water_then_espresso/i3w5eec/'

I have been using one since 1984 (I got it from my grandmother who brought it back from a trip to Italy in the 70s).  Watch James Hoffman’s video tutorials on Moka Pots. The main key is to brew slowly over low heat and start with boiling water in the bottom chamber. Any grind on the finer side will work. Store bought coffee is good enough. Illy is pretty good and I have enjoyed a lot of it in my Moka Pot.  They usually put out about 100 ml of coffee. Measure that amount of water and pour it in the top and you will now the approximate level at which it is “done”.   I like an “Americano” made by adding another 100 ml of hot water and cappuccinos made by adding 120 ml of (microwaved) hot frothed milk using a hand frother.  Once you figure out to use them Moka Pots are quite forgiving as they don’t require a “perfect” grind. A cheap blade grinder will yield some damn good coffee. Then you can upgrade to a better grinder at your leisure.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tyyo4k/how_well_would_this_combination_work_i_am_a/i3vwwc8/'

This is just a standart Italian household. Nothing more. But it will give you a decent coffee for sure if you are not that much into it. This is more like a novice. Beginner is one step up.  The Moka is a good start but to consider it to be a beginner setup the bare minimum is a grinder. I would say nothing bellow hario slim. The next step will be finding speciality coffee from different coffee roasters. When you have a moka pot grinder and coffee from some decent roaster that is the beginner setup :)   Illy or tchibo or just the coffe you can buy in the supermarket is burnt. The coffee beans should not be black but brown.  They just roast it at amazing volume with focus on consistency rather than quality.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tyyo4k/how_well_would_this_combination_work_i_am_a/i3vlvfa/'

Its easy to make a bad coffee with them too I recommend watching James Hoffmanns Ultimate Moka Pot Technique video on YouTube.

Thanks !,I started making coffee using a moka pot and preground coffee as well. While asking for advice is nice and is informative it is more important to try things out for yourself and find out what your preferences are. Some people here are pretty hardcore. They dont like adding anything to their coffee. They hate dark roasts (hides the beans special flavor) etc.   I used all sorts of pre-ground coffee during my moka pot years. Illy Lavazza Starbucks Nabob etc. Whatever I could find in my grocery store I gave it a shot. I thought Lavazza and Illy gave me a cup that I like. I liked the red label the most out of all the Illy ones. And I liked Rossa beans the most out of the Lavazza choices. For Starbucks I liked pike place roast the most.   When you are able to spend more on coffee I would recommend the next progression to be a Hario hand grinder a French Press an Aeropress a scale that shows weight in 0.1 grams and a hario v60. Most of these are pretty affordable. I have spent thousands on my coffee hobby.

Thanks !,So what I do is that I fill the part where you should put the coffee in such a way that its full but not compact. then I heat the water on the heating plate without the coffee or the top part. When water is boiling I put the coffe and thet top part and bring the heat down when coffee starts to flow in the upper part. I bring it down so that it doesnt start splashing everywhere and ruin the taste. I guess this fulfills most the requirements to make the most of this coffee right ?     As for the grind its not written anywhere on the box what thinness it is. I read once it should be medium for Moka tea pot but cant really tell myself by looking at the ground coffee..,i3viwgt,/r/Coffee/comments/tyyo4k/how_well_would_this_combination_work_i_am_a/i3vjajh/'

I would even say if you are not into acidic instead of bitter coffee this is totally fine (Although I am condescending about people who brag about their expensive 300$ espresso machine with integrated grinder those are usually horrible people but that is it).  When I lived in France I had to survive at the store bought coffee and grinder even worse than the Hario slim (France had really horrible coffee culture) with Aeropress. It will get the job done but with better coffee and entry level grinder the world will open up :),i3vmv98,/r/Coffee/comments/tyyo4k/how_well_would_this_combination_work_i_am_a/i3vppub/'

Yes it’s important but grinding fresh with any burr grinder will be better than canned coffee by a factor of about 100X. Improvements to the grinder from there are smaller improvements and it doesn’t need to be perfect right away.  A decent hand burr grinder can be had for less than US$30 and electric for around US$100.,i3vmv98,/r/Coffee/comments/tyyo4k/how_well_would_this_combination_work_i_am_a/i3vuh0a/'

I am a beginner in the world of coffee and unsure of how good a bialetti coffee pot is and hot well it can work with this type of coffee. Thanks !,With the Moka there will always be water left in the bottom because of how it works.  Water left in the bottom is necessary.  When full the water heats up then starts to boil.  The boiling water turns into steam which starts to fill the top of the water chamber pressing against the bottom of the grounds chamber.  Then more steam gets released from boiling.  Then more...  The pressure rises in the top of the water chamber and pushes down on the water in there.  The water has nowhere to go but up into the grounds chamber and then into the top so thats where it goes.  When most of the water in the bottom is gone the water level drops below the bottom of the spout.  At that point the steam building up in the top can start to shoot up the spout.  So it does - and then the water doesnt go up the spout anymore.  Brewing starts to splutter.  That steam going through the coffee doesnt produce good tasting coffee at that point.,i3voq1l,/r/Coffee/comments/tyyo4k/how_well_would_this_combination_work_i_am_a/i3vqlf8/'

Illy coffee is decent for beginners and offers a very classic coffee taste but I will echo others here in that its potentially too finely ground to get the best results here.

Just assemble it and place the whole thing on heat until you begin to see it brew then turn the heat down.

I am a beginner in the world of coffee and unsure of how good a bialetti coffee pot is and hot well it can work with this type of coffee. Thanks !,Im French and I have to agree on this. There are quite a lot of roasteries here but most of them are very traditional (i.e. burnt unsourced coffee). However since French people dont know much about coffee brewing and coffee as a product they think these stores and a fully automatic machine like you described are as good as it gets and that they know it all. Things are changing though with more and more specialty roasters popping here and there but the road is still long. I dont mean to be condecending either people can drink what they want and its fine not everyone wants to spend lots of money and time on coffee. But the ignorance and satisfaction that comes with it is tiring. It must be a torture to work in a specialty shop here and have to deal with it all the time.,i3vppub,/r/Coffee/comments/tyyo4k/how_well_would_this_combination_work_i_am_a/i3vwb8m/'

One thing you didnt mention is if you had a grinder. Having a grinder allows you to have many more options. Moreover I dont think any producer has pre-ground coffee that works well in a French Press. Moreover I am a huge fan of scandinavian light roasts and fruity Ethiopian washed coffees so I have no clue about what coffees would work well roasted dark. You could try to see if the following two producers have something that might interest you: le piantagioni del caffè ditta artigianale. Cheaper choice could be caffelab (they pregrind you could try an espresso blend ground for Moka NOT Espresso). If you dont find anything appealing just DM me Ill try to figure something out.,i3wefdw,/r/Coffee/comments/tyyo4k/how_well_would_this_combination_work_i_am_a/i3wyi6g/'

You can get a [3rd party one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/54mm-Single-Coffee-Filter-Basket/dp/B08W874TL6) for a bit more money.  The [IMS basket](https://www.amazon.com/Precision-compatible-Breville-Espresso-BES810BSS/dp/B0922Z67KK) is probably the best quality and even more expensive.  If you get a [bottomless portafilter](https://www.amazon.com/Bottomless-Portafilter-MATOW-Compatible-Breville/dp/B08D89QWY5/) most of them come with a pretty decent filter basket.

Just received my Mini today and was absolutely delighted by this coincidence (?),If it makes you feel better mine was slated for dispatch in mid April so I think it came on the earlier side. I did an aeropress brew to try it out and it was an extremely clean cup. I did some messing around with espresso as well and it handled it like a champ. Adjustability seems quite good for making tweaks so far. The factory zero point is pretty damn close to actual zero I thought Id have to make a much greater note of it.   My previous grinder was a blender-style blade grinder so take my experience with a grain of salt lol. Overall Im extremely pleased.  Sound level is great I wouldnt describe it as having any small motor whiny noise.  They seem to have updated the 3D printed finger/popcorning guard too. It is still 3D printed but they are using an SLA printer now it seems. You have to really search under a bright light to see layer lines.  Also its so tiny!!

i3u3wqv,2022-04-07 17:32:21,BubbleSmith,tyq2tf,Buying Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate in Canada,If its not heptahydrate (but is still food safe) its easy enough to assist the recipe. Just add up all the atomic weights (Google each one) and ratio it.  eg. If you need 50g of heptahydrate but can only get monohydrate:  MgSO4·7H2O = 24.3 + 32 + (16 * 4) + (7 * (1 + 1 + 16)) = 246.3 MgSO4·1H2O = 24.3 + 32 + (16 * 4) 1 + 1 + 16 = 138.3  138.3 / 246.3 = 0.562  This is your ratio so just multiply that by the needed amount:  50g * 0.562 = 28.1g  The total atomic weights of all the different forms are on Wikipedia to save you adding them up: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate (Under Properties and Molar mass)  When converting like this the only tough bit to remember can be which number you divide by which at the end. The easy way to remember here is that monohydrate has less water in it so will weigh less and you wont need as much so you need a factor of <1 to get a smaller answer.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tyq2tf/buying_magnesium_sulphate_heptahydrate_in_canada/i3u3wqv/'

i3sws86,2022-04-07 12:36:43,marshallfrost,tyirrg,What is the coffee etiquette in an office?,Coming from an office drone for the past several years I would say there are some common etiquette rules:  If you empty the pot make another batch before you get back to the grind dont make it someone elses problem  Dont make a new full pot after a certain reasonable time (say 3 pm when no one else will drink it and it will just be wasted)  Do not assume creamer and other additives from a nearby fridge is yours for the taking. Its likely someones personal stash.   Clean up after yourself if you make a mess.   Dont be surprised if there are more office politics centered around getting and making coffee. No one is beyond pettiness. Ive heard it all. 50 cents per cup that no one really paid. Only x amount of scoops per batch. Shits crazy. When dealing with that stuff I typically found it less aggravating to just make time to make coffee from home or get it somewhere else.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tyirrg/what_is_the_coffee_etiquette_in_an_office/i3sws86/'
i3sk8lf,2022-04-07 11:18:31,guesswho-2022,tyirrg,What is the coffee etiquette in an office?,These are all great questions but theyre honestly being asked in the wrong place - you need to ask these questions in your office! I guarantee you no one will feel mad or offended or anything like that. These are the sorts of things that can vary from office to office **just** enough that its worth knowing how they work in **your** particular office the community vs. personal grounds one is a great example - they could be there for everyone or they could just be someones personal grounds that they happen to keep near the coffee maker. Youll never know for sure if you dont ask.  Even your final question about washing the coffee pot is something that might work differently in different offices - in some offices if you finish the pot not only would you be expected to clean the pot but also to start another pot so that anyone else who comes along would be able to get some coffee right away without having to wait. And even that can vary according to the time of day - maybe people drink coffee in the afternoon in your office but in other offices coffee is strictly a morning thing. The point is youll never know these things for sure if you dont ask. So take all the questions that youve asked here and ask them to someone in your office - theyll know much more about how it works there than some random redditors. 🙂,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tyirrg/what_is_the_coffee_etiquette_in_an_office/i3sk8lf/'

I would probably check to make sure theres no coffee club so youre not stepping on toes.  More than likely the coffee is for everyone to take but just make sure.

i3w8ppu,2022-04-08 06:03:59,BetterSupermarket110,tyg95r,Why is my coffee never hot enough once its done brewing?,Simply put transfer of energy can lower the temperature of any thing. In this case not everything around your apparatus has the same temperature as your boiling water. Even the grounds are not heated. Even if you preheat stuff the rooms temperature will also play a role in decreasing any heat. The process itself (brewing) also uses energy. Heat (energy) just gets transferred/used so your final brew temperature will most of the time be lower. I think James Hoffman has a video about this too (or at least mentioned about why temperature gets low in passing).     Also the most proper way of drinking coffee is not really to drink it scalding hot you wont taste some of the notes at high temperature. You will taste more once your coffee cools down a little. But of course preference is another thing. If you really prefer it scalding hot then of course you do you. :),-,/r/Coffee/comments/tyg95r/why_is_my_coffee_never_hot_enough_once_its_done/i3w8ppu/'

i3wyt1m,2022-04-08 08:57:52,Salreus,tyg95r,Why is my coffee never hot enough once its done brewing?,If you want to retain heat make sure you are using an insulated mug with a lid. Start off by boiling water and fill your mug completely with boiling water and cover with lid. Grind your coffee and set up your work flow. Warm your equipment before starting. right when you start brewing take lid off insulated mug and dump water. Brew coffee and once completed put lid back on mug. Always keep lid on mug. if you are wanting hot coffee without being in something insulated then its not going to happen....for long anyway.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tyg95r/why_is_my_coffee_never_hot_enough_once_its_done/i3wyt1m/'

i3tawvb,2022-04-07 14:08:23,milliebarnes,tyg95r,Why is my coffee never hot enough once its done brewing?,The water temperature should be about 190 when you do the poor over and it should be 150 when you take your first sip of coffee. I stopped using a French press years ago because I could not deal with the drop in temperature. So what I do is fill my coffee cup with boiling water and I use a styrofoam cover to keep it warm. I have 12 goes on a teapot which has Velcro on it so it wraps around my cup nicely. Then when I get the coffee ready I pour the hot water out of the cup and immediately for the coffee over the ground. While its continuing to drip a little bit I cover it with pot holders that has one side that is silicone.

If you have a plastic storage container lid that fits on top of the brewer itll keep the heat in. Just let it steam until it gets plenty hot.

i3rvlzn,2022-04-07 08:37:28,novacthall,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Hey beaners coffee newbie here. Im trying to make a good cup and coming up short and I hope you can help me learn a thing or two to improve my game.  My wife bought me a Cona vacuum coffee maker because Im a chemical engineer/huge nerd. I dont drink coffee but she does so Ive been making her a cup in the morning to help get her day going. The instructions say to steep the coffee in the top chamber for 2 to 3 minutes before snuffing the wick and letting the infused water back into the bowl. Seems simple enough. The problem is following the instructions produce a drink thats overly bitter. So I cut back from 2:30 to 1:30 still bitter. This morning I tried 1:00 and its still bitter. Im using a Starbucks ground that meets the fine/coarse requirement of the Cona which I confirm because all the grounds stay in the top so Im at least doing that right.  Things I think I may be doing wrong in no particular order:  * The Cona I have is a size D but Im only making 12 ounces of coffee in it. The instructions on the coffee grounds say to use 1.5 tbsp per 6 ounces of water so Im dropping 3 tbsp in the top. My math is right but since Im making a smaller batch do I need to dial back how long the grounds infuse the water?  * Its unclear to me when to start the timer. I *was* waiting to start the timer until the vapor bubbled into the top chamber but for a 12 ounce cup it takes about 40 seconds for the water to travel into the upper chamber. Does that mean before I was steeping for 0:40+2:30=3:10? But even then cutting down to a minute on the bubbles is 1:40 of steep which is still less time than the instructions say.  * I dont think blame lies with the bean but maybe Im using it wrong? The Starbucks stuff were using is a honey and vanilla something-or-other (I speak Starbucks even worse than I speak coffee I apologize) that she bought at Target. The instructions on the back just tell me the ratio of grounds to water.  I plan to try even less time tomorrow but this is purely trial-and-error and I dont feel that my guesses are terribly educated. Any advice is welcome.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3rvlzn/'
i3s3iv3,2022-04-07 09:30:07,Objection401,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Grinder comparison question - I have a 1Zpresso JX-Pro that I currently use for pour over and espresso. Considering buying an electric grinder but not sure which.  Looking at the Niche Zero and the Turin DF64/G-Iota as options. I’ve heard the Niche’s conical burrs bring out chocolate flavors & body in espresso and the DF64’s flat burrs bring out more clarity/separation of flavors.  My question is: if I keep my current hand grinder will I see much difference in flavor with the Niche? The JX-Pro has 48mm burrs to the Niche’s 64mm conicals so is that enough to make a difference in taste between the two? Or is it worth it to go with the DF64 if I keep my JX-Pro so that I can have the flat burr taste and still have the conical JX-Pro for when I want the more chocolate/rich flavors and higher body? Will any of this make a difference for pour over? Thanks!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3s3iv3/'

i3z99nc,2022-04-08 18:21:02,Notsocooldad,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yes.  I do.  I make either a 10 oz or 20 oz batch of coffee daily depending on how much coffee I feel like drinking.    You do need to play with the grind size and I have the stop at half flow.  You may also need to play with the amount of coffee you add.  It will take a few tries but I have no doubt that you can make good coffee.    I have a KBT model and disabled the little white switch so I can brew directly into a Hydroflask instead of the carafe.    Not sure how much of a difference it makes but before brewing I run about 20oz of water through the machine.  It wets the filter and I use some of the water to make my instant oatmeal.

So if we assume (assumption here is the cop out) that their 100ml comment is about a 1:16 ratio brew our coffee weight would be 6.25g and then if we assume an extraction of 20% our TDS mass becomes 1.25g. Using 237mg per 1.25g of coffee we can calculate that an 18g dose espresso with a 20% extraction would have 682mg of caffeine.,i3qxc0p,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3r18i5/'
i3r4824,2022-04-07 05:11:10,_Insider,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Since caffeine is very soluble the caffeine content largely depends on the amount of ground coffee you put in not preparation method. So its hard to convert without knowing the amount of coffee used for 100ml. Usually people use 18g of coffee for 300ml of filter coffee (i.e. a cup) or a 40-50ml espresso (a double) so both beverages would have the same (total) caffeine content.,i3qxc0p,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3r4824/'

i3rxn8n,2022-04-07 08:50:52,_Insider,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Blue Mountain is very unspecific since recipes massively depend on the roast not the origin. If you know the roaster maybe someone who has had the same coffee can share their experience.   Just to give some general thoughts on expensive and fancy coffee it is important to keep in mind that its still coffee and you dont need to reinvent the wheel to brew it. You will have to dial it in so to get the most out of a small bag I would recommend that you pick a method that you are familiar with and you can reliably and consistently produce great cups with while you can dial in quickly without wasting too much coffee. Most people would probably choose the Aeropress and just use their usual recipe as a starting point.,i3rd2ie,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3rxn8n/'
i3uag4o,2022-04-07 18:20:21,yahat,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,What the other commentor said was correct most Blue Mountain coffee that Ive seen is usually a darker roast.  If that is the case with yours I agree with the commentor in that starting with your usual recipe and grind is a good point and you can always change it from there but darker roasts benefit from a coarser grind and quicker extraction.  It takes less time to extract the more bitter flavour compounds so you may find cutting it shorter will result in a nicer coffee.,i3rd2ie,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3uag4o/'

It’s really useful.   According to the compass sour means it’s under extracted. Here’s the advice:   >	Extract More Use Less Coffee  >	Use a finer grind and/or longer brew time to extract more. Increase the Brew Ratio by fixing the water weight and using less coffee OR by fixing the dose and using more water.  I don’t think re-roasting coffee helps.

i3s3bb6,2022-04-07 09:28:46,sqwtrp,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,this type of brewing is going to be tough to troubleshoot more of a novelty than a sure way of getting good coffee. I would try reducing the contact time even more you seem to be headed in the right direction there. You might try using some lighter-roast coffee which can take more heat without producing as bitter a brew.  I think with this method you are brewing with boiling hot water sorta-twice so you would want the contact time to be pretty short.  I guess it might help to get the boiler hotter to control contact time but I wouldnt want to shock the brewing section by plunging it into boiling water either. I dislike brewers made of glass due to the danger of sudden thermal shock breakage.,i3rvlzn,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3s3bb6/'

They let the water rise to the top chamber and then add the coffee. This will give you a bit more control.   During the draw-down of your water there is still extraction happening.

i3sn3wm,2022-04-07 11:35:59,realplyx,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,If you like the taste of conical burrs and want an electrical workflow with them then the Niche is really good. I think if you want to make a purchase that maximizes difference in taste (not necessarily talking about whether or not you like that difference) then the DF64 is likely going to be more obviously different than your JX-Pro.  Personally I’d go for the DF64 just because I place value purely in having the ability to try different grinder types.   That said there’s also another thing to consider with the Niche vs DF64 which is usability. The Niche is considered to be “better designed” from an ease of use standpoint because you simply don’t need to modify it,i3s3iv3,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3sn3wm/'
i3u45vx,2022-04-07 17:34:13,MikeTheBlueCow,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,As far as conical burr vs conical burr the taste issue going to be that different *only/just* because of size of the burr it has a lot to do with the burr design. So someone would likely have to have used both the JX PRO and the Niche Zero/mazzer grinder that those burrs were borrowed from in order to compare the taste differences. I dont have a JX PRO but I can provide an anecdote from my personal experience - I have a Lido 3 hand grinder and it produces less fines more clarity less body than the Niche Zero. Not a massive difference but it was still significant in a side-by-side. So the Lido was my pour over grinder and the Niche my espresso grinder. I decided to get a Df64 With SSP burrs for my pour over grinder and so far its doing well but almost seems a little soft. I havent compared any of the grinders directly yet the DF64 is still seasoning. Im not sure how the DF64s default burrs compare with the SSP burrs aside from the default burrs being more espresso focused.,i3s3iv3,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3u45vx/'
i3stdz5,2022-04-07 12:15:13,PutTheMoneyInMyAzz,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Depends on how you brew your coffee. Immersion brewing in something like a french press tends to require coarsly ground coffee pour-over is a bit different since there are recipes that require a coarser ground while others require a finer (medium) one. And for something like the aeropress where the contact time between beans and water tends to be below 3 minutes for a lot of recipes you will need to go finer than for the average pour-over recipe. But thats all just in general idk about your setup and recipe or if you use a machine. However there are a lot of great videos in YouTube explaining the correlations very well. You should take a look at if your grinder came with instructions thats where you should find how many clicks will do for which brew method. Other than that just experiment! You dont need to get the exact setting on your first go,i3sqdvs,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3stdz5/'
i3uk5v5,2022-04-07 19:31:24,devnop,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,If you have to you can work around lack of grind size adjustment by changing the dose and pull parameters. With manual espresso you have a lot of flexibility around pre-infusion and pressure profiles. Generally a flair will prefer a somewhat coarser grind because of the deep/narrow basket. Choosing more forgiving darker roasts you will have the most chance of success. But yes you ideally want a proper espresso grinder.,i3ss2gp,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3uk5v5/'
i3t0jxz,2022-04-07 13:00:30,steelbeerbottle,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I would skip upgrading the burrs and save towards a dedicated espresso hand grinder like the JX Pro.

i3w71si,2022-04-08 05:51:10,overextraction,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,This might have two explanations. Option 1 is drinking temperature. When something has an extreme temperature (very hot or very cold) we taste less. You can see this effect with the taste difference between ice cream and melted ice cream. The melted ice cream tastes a lot sweeter because its warmer. In coffee this mean that as the coffee cools down the taste changes. It is possible that the ice cubes cooled your beverage down to a temperature where you could taste more/different things.  Option 2 is that the dilution helped distinguish the flavors. Compare an espresso with an americano. The americano has more nuanced flavors due to the dilution.,i3vnc5u,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3w71si/'

The novelty of the Cona is absolutely the plus for me. Its got a mad scientist feel about it that I like and when Ive had coffee made for me in one at a restaurant its always tasted good to me (but again hardly a coffee drinker so my opinion here is nearly worthless). I didnt think to taste at the time for bitterness but this is all a part of the journey. Im trying to learn and appreciate you helping me.  I also share your apprehension with the glassware. I baby this thing for fear of a break that Ill inevitably have to clean up. I heat my water in a small metal pot on the stove before I transfer it to the glass pot and to avoid shocking the glass I hold it over the stove to catch some heat to warm up a little. That also helps the water not lose too much heat by being poured onto room temperature glass since the little alcohol burner can only do so much work. Some of my early trials with this thing started with cold water and it took forever for the burner to heat a liter of water to boiling.

i3x07vj,2022-04-08 09:06:48,PutTheMoneyInMyAzz,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yeah no as I said there isnt a lot of residue certainly none that I cant get out by gently blowing against the burrs. I recommend mixing a few water drops into your coffee beans before grinding in case youre not already doing it. I unscrew my grinder every few months and even after two years of use there are no signs of rust yet. However if what youre having is not a static issue then I dont know how to help you unfortunately,i3td7p1,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3x07vj/'
i3sxzrn,2022-04-07 12:44:27,VibrantCoffee,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Oh awesome glad to hear it!  If you prefer lighter fruitier espressos at slightly longer ratios then the Filtro is likely much better than the BE grinder. If youre going medium/chocolatey at more traditional 1:2 ratio or so then it will be more of a toss-up but Id still say the Filtro is going to be better.,i3sxci0,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3sxzrn/'
i3rv039,2022-04-07 08:33:20,taikowork,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Im thinking it is just underextraction- underdeveloped or underroasted beans taste grassy and vegetal usually not sour. Sour is usually an indicator for underextraction which can be helped by grinding finer. A good test would be to grind them extremely fine and steeping longer if it tastes bitter/astringent then it is the grind and not the beans themselves. With the tasting notes of raspberry I would expect them to be more light and acidic than most beans and they may just not be to your liking which is okay too.  As a general rule if its sour grind finer and if its then bitter grind coarser.,i3rs0av,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3rv039/'
i3w7zcl,2022-04-08 05:58:23,overextraction,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,What do you expect of your machine? Are you fine with a pressurized portafilter or do you want non-pressurized? How much of a hobby do you want to make out of it? Would a manual espresso machine (like the Flair) be something for you?  Do you want new or is used also okay?

i4bqjlg,2022-04-11 11:22:44,overextraction,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Im not really sure. You can try to increase your dose. This will make the flavors stronger and might help you get the same taste with a hotter beverage. Just be aware that with more coffee the water will be able to extract less so you should compensate for this.  On the other hand increasing you dose might also make it even more overwhelming. Sorry Im not much of a help here.,i3wk7on,/r/Coffee/comments/ty9na3/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i4bqjlg/'
i3wa1jz,2022-04-08 06:14:02,VibrantCoffee,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Its not even the pressure. It just gets extracted very quickly.

i3szoow,2022-04-07 12:55:04,VibrantCoffee,ty9na3,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,It all depends on how the grinder is zeroed. You might need to go as fine as it goes or might not.

What is your budget?    2. How much involvement can you handle?      a. As fast as possible?      b. I can tolerate faff temperature surfing and manual grinding dont scare me.      c. Somewhere in between elaborate please.   3. Are you okay with buying used? What level of DIY are you comfortable with?   4. Milk drinks or straight shots or are both a priority?   5. What kind of espresso shots do you want to achieve?      a. I want traditional shots full of chocolate a perfect blend of bitter and sweet (mostly medium-dark to dark roasts)      b. I just want sweet chocolate and some fruits (mostly mediums)      c. Just give me something sweet vibrant and fruity (mostly light and even Nordic roasts)   6. Do you anticipate getting into nerdy things such as profiling? (fine tuning extraction to find different flavors/textures)   7. What are your priorities regarding noise aesthetics and size?,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txwwbt/overwhelmed_by_variety_and_burdened_by_my/i3omfqk/'
i3olekv,2022-04-06 14:40:17,itbespauldo,txwwbt,Overwhelmed by variety and burdened by my ignorance,I’ve never considered getting into espresso until I really paid attention to the Flair Espresso Machine. The Flair Classic is only $160 and with a good grinder I’ve heard it’s a real powerhouse for espresso for the price,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txwwbt/overwhelmed_by_variety_and_burdened_by_my/i3olekv/'
i3su8bo,2022-04-07 12:20:32,Muffintime53,txwwbt,Overwhelmed by variety and burdened by my ignorance,I saw your budget 2000 is more than enough past that and youre paying for very premium quality of life things like a rotary pump.    Another thing is Im no expert and these are just some of my personal recommendations. Also wont get top nerdy as you can look up reviews online    Some vocab I use in case you are very new  Prosumer: like a mix between a commercial and home machine higher steam power and commercial grade quality in a usually smaller machine  PID: water temp controls    Some really nice machines Ive used are the  Gaggia Classic (A Tier $400. Arguably the best budget home machine). If you are on a tight budget and want some shots/consistency on par with lower end prosumer espresso machines go for this.  Rancilio Silvia (A Tier $830. Intro to prosumer machine also very good for the price). If you dont want to spend lots of money but still want a commercial grade machine go for this.  Lelit Bianca (S Tier $2600. Basically rancilio silvia but with the e61 group head a different design and dual boiler also has a temperature PID and pressure gagues quite expensive though). If you want a sexy E61 machine with wood accents go for this.  Nuova Simonelli Oscar 2 (S tier $1300 open box $1600 brand new. Shot timing and programmable buttons. You need to time the shots on all the other machines on this list. Sexy and minimal design World Barista Championship steam tip (also REALLY POWERFUL STEAM for the price range) all around great machine. One problem no temperature PID). On a budget and want a brand trusted by World Barista Championship and also dont care about a PID get this one.    Some machines Ive never used but look a bit promising  Decent Espresso DE1 (S Tier $3400) Super expensive but basically an espresso nerds wet dream. I dont recommend starting off with a machine like this as its expensive if you really get hooked onto espresso sell your machine and buy this. There is SO MUCH CUSTOMIZABLITY. Shot profiles flow control shot analyzes and the ability to bluetooth pair with a scale to time/weigh shots. There is an ONLINE DATABASE of dialed in profiles that will give you a weight flow graphs and so many statistics. Check out these reviews/showcases theres just SO MUCH info  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMX6SfPLBQU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4saVBslgEA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9RSFFUaafY&t=252s Really the only con is some people dont like the looks and the steam wand is not weak but not as strong as the other machines (at least it looks that way in videos). Some people dont really like the digital touch to turn on steam/start pulling a shot and prefer a lever/knob. These two cons are just some small nitpicks its basically a perfect espresso machines if you love the looks and are okay with a digital control instead of physical knobs/levers. If you are a huge nerd and are deep in the rabbit hole get this.  ECM Classika PID (A Tier $1600) Basically a lelit bianca but without a dual boiler and wood accents. Not too many differences but it is $1000 cheaper. I havent looked into this machine too much but Ive seem some people say good stuff about this machine online. If you like the lelit bianca but think its too expensive get this.    I guess a new grinder isnt needed but it could improve speed/consistancy a bit. I dont know much about hand grinders so I apologize if Im wrong.  Niche Zero (S Tier $700-800) Kinda like the single dosing king. Single dosing is basically weighing beans putting it in the grinder and running it through. People do this so they can switch beans without having to use a different grinder it also reduces the amount of stale coffee and makes weighing coffee easier for nitpicks like me who care about anything more than 0.2 grams off. Also has nice wood accents pretty nice looking ig. Want the best single dose grinder get this.  Rocket Faustino (S Tier $800-900) Not made for single dosing but I guess you can single dose on most grinders but there might be 0.1-0.3g of retention which doesnt effect much. Does have timed programming good for making drinks back to back or making drinks more quickly compared to single dosing. Nice looking grinder and well built. Not single dosing and have money to spend get this.  Sette 270 (S Tier $400) Basically THE budget grinder. Low retention (0.1-0.3g) which means you can single dose you can also just leave beans in the hopper if you like. Stepless grind adjustment (just like the two above that are twice the price) fast grinding and very consistent. Programed timing/profiles. Its basically a grinder almost as good as the Faustino but half the price and a bit ugly in my opinion. On a budget go for this one.  one more thing there are crew reviews on seattle coffee gear on youtube for like 90% of these watch them for more info they go over most of the stuff about the machines.  Lets hope i didnt further confuse you. Tell me which ones you will consider :),-,/r/Coffee/comments/txwwbt/overwhelmed_by_variety_and_burdened_by_my/i3su8bo/'

i3qh0uo,2022-04-07 00:24:58,vroombadeux,txwwbt,Overwhelmed by variety and burdened by my ignorance,Flairs make fantastic espressos full stop.  I gave up on my Signature for two reasons: (1) it took me way too much time and attention for it to be a morning coffee solution because of preheating (2) I scorched my fingertips too many times because I refused to use tongs and towels when assembling.   I upgraded to a Cafelat Robot which I love dearly but it costs 2x a Flair Signature. And since I saw that you work with light roasts I don’t know if it would serve you the same way because I do not have to preheat the Robot at all (I use med-dark roasts). Some people say they don’t preheat for light roasts but I would go in knowing you might need to preheat the piston with hot water.   Flair 58 would probably be best for you because of the heating element but costs even more than a Robot and has questionable power electronics.   I can’t compare to “regular” machines because I’ve never had one. I need a no maintenance setup so the JX-Pro and Robot knock out an espresso every morning in about 8 minutes max including cleanup. I’ve heard some people are faster but I’d say 10min is the upper bound after you get the routine down.   Ultimately manuals punch way above their price class on taste but it comes at the expense of workflow.

i3ukdn9,2022-04-07 19:33:02,Muffintime53,txwwbt,Overwhelmed by variety and burdened by my ignorance,havent used many grinders sadly just the niche zero rocket faustino and sette 270  edit: actually nvm those are like in the top 5 most popular grinders all of them are good just depending on what you will use them for (single dose or keeping beans in the hopper) and how much you are willing to spend for extra features. also never used a mignon grinder people seem to like them a lot.,i3uflvy,/r/Coffee/comments/txwwbt/overwhelmed_by_variety_and_burdened_by_my/i3ukdn9/'
i3oybji,2022-04-06 16:11:43,ksl982,txwwbt,Overwhelmed by variety and burdened by my ignorance,The commandante should be fine if you’re ok with hand grinding for around a minute per shot ( not sure how fast it takes me but guessing around that and assuming the commandante is around similar speed since it’s beeen a while since I’ve used one) I’m currently using a jx -pro and it works great fine for grinding size and adjustment just wish I had an electric grinder when I’m dialing in or making multiple shots so that’s a consideration.  If you want a good electric grinder for beginner espresso with some room to grow id probably look at the sette 270 niche zero or eureka mignon ( spécialita or silencio I think are best for espresso from that line but I’m not certain) these would be around $400-700 for the grinder but you can most likely hold off on the grinder since you have a commandante for now.  For the machine you could be looking at a ranchilio Silvia pro rocket apartmento lelit Mara x or ECM classica which are all around the $1600 mark new I think leaving room for accessories like tamper WDT tool Baskets etc.  If you wanted an electric grinder I’d probably start looking at machines around the $1000 mark like the quick mill silvano or ranchilio Silvia (non pro model).  You can also look into modifications for machines since many of the cheaper ones have many things that can be changed and improved,i3otfpz,/r/Coffee/comments/txwwbt/overwhelmed_by_variety_and_burdened_by_my/i3oybji/'

I’m glad I came on here or else I would have never considered a leaver machine. I’m currently restructuring my budget to justify the purchase ASAP so thanks again for the input. The preheating element on the 58 solved the biggest problem that was keeping me from ever considering a Flair.

The other thing to consider is that grinding fine enough for a 58mm is much more difficult than grinding for filter so you may find yourself wanting to get an electric espresso grinder.

At some point I simply stopped using the timer because I was getting the impression that it was skewing my perception of the flavor in the cup due to the it was too short must me underextracted - it was too long must be bitter voices going on automatically in my head as soon as the numbers came up.

i3s7si1,2022-04-07 09:57:32,spedzop,txvwxz,Ideal drawdown for V60?,Could be the type of filter paper too much agitation causing fines to settle and clog etc. My v60 draw downs are typically between 2:30 and 4 minutes depending on brew method close to 3:30 in most cases.  For me Cafec yellow filters on average shave off 15 seconds compared to the Hario tabless filter. Using melodrip also tends to make my draw downs a little quicker for pulse methods.

i3tdlf2,2022-04-07 14:26:37,areychaltahai,txvwxz,Ideal drawdown for V60?,Theres no universal ideal drawdown time. If it tastes good everythings fine.   That being said if you want to experiment and figure out if somethings not going right figure out what the slow phases of your brewing process is. If your brew starts choking at later stages especially if its tremendously slow after you finish pouring it might be from fines clogging the filter.   Also what others already suggested try going a little coarser on the grind. That should get you faster brews but make sure youre not compromising on taste just to hit an arbitrary time goal.  And make sure youre not trying to pour faster to speed up your brew it is counter-productive as it makes fines settle down quicker and clog up the filter.  I am not too into coffee bed analysis but it does indicate  obvious problems with technique/grind at times. But at the end of the day taste and repeatability are the only objectives you should optimize for.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txvwxz/ideal_drawdown_for_v60/i3tdlf2/'
i3wmkz1,2022-04-08 07:39:54,HalseyStan,txvwxz,Ideal drawdown for V60?,I use the V60 everyday as my primary brewer.  To me it’s usually a reference to grind. More than 3:30 grind coarser  Less than 3:00 grind finer.  But as many have said taste is the judge If u have some bitterness in ur cup it’s safe to assume it’s because of the fine grind size.  If it taste great then u have nothing to worry about.  All the info given is by assuming ur making hot coffee not iced.

i3qtitb,2022-04-07 03:17:30,MikeTheBlueCow,txvwxz,Ideal drawdown for V60?,Now that its established the primary fish is for it to taste good and theres no need to change your grind size... Since you were wondering could it taste better if the timing was different - you can try going coarser and using pouring technique and minimizing agitation in order to shorten the brew time and find out the difference which will likely be a thinner body it may have some clearer notes and be sweeter or it may seem weaker.   It might be a long brew time just because the coffee has more fines.

Thats the ratio I use for origami+kalita filter brews but I go for 20g to 333ish grams of water for v60.   Tastes good=dont put more thought into brewing that specific coffee unless youre trying to experiment with different results  I would use draw down as a measuring tool across brews of the same coffee.

i43plcn,2022-04-09 17:27:37,Ethril,txvwxz,Ideal drawdown for V60?,I usually bloom off boil and then control the drop in temp for subsequent pours. It’s that drop and grind coarseness that I vary bean to bean but also agitation to a lesser degree.  For example lighter roasts tend to do better with higher temps through all the pours. But high elevation beans will grind with more fines leading to slower draw downs so I tend to compensate with a finer grind for consistency and lower temps.  But then a darker roast I’ll grind coarser pour cooler and agitate substantially more. Those denser beans that crush into more fines I minimize agitation as much as I can.,i3swwkx,/r/Coffee/comments/txvwxz/ideal_drawdown_for_v60/i43plcn/'
i4lvo1u,2022-04-13 12:47:45,Caspid,txvwxz,Ideal drawdown for V60?,Generally a good idea since darker roasts extract faster / light roasts are tougher to extract.

i4n4a4u,2022-04-13 17:59:34,Caspid,txvwxz,Ideal drawdown for V60?,I think so mostly due to the degassing of fresh beans impairing extraction. Thats somewhat balanced by water moving slower through those beans. Whether you need to grind finer or coarser probably depends on more things though. e.g. as a coffee ages the lighter notes (floral/fruity/etc) get subdued and you may need to coarsen the grind to get more of the base notes and sweetness as well as increase the dose to get a stronger flavor (which also requires coarsening).  Espresso might be different due to the effects of flow rate though.

i3o4u6p,2022-04-06 12:56:27,MyCatsNameIsBernie,txu4pk,I Took the Plunge -- Espresso Tips (Breville Bambino),For the best tasting espresso listen to your friend and ignore the defaults. Comparing grind setting numbers with others is an exercise in futility as they will vary with beans and grinder calibration. Just dial in your grind for best taste.  I learned to dial in using the methods on [Barista Hustle](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/espresso-recipes-putting-it-all-together/). I fix the dose find the best tasting ratio and finally adjust grind for the best taste. 18:35 is a good starting point but shouldnt be the end goal - you need to experiment and see what tastes best.  If your Bambino did not come with single wall/non-pressurized baskets then you need to get yourself one.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txu4pk/i_took_the_plunge_espresso_tips_breville_bambino/i3o4u6p/'
i3o96kc,2022-04-06 13:23:01,raspberrythunder,txu4pk,I Took the Plunge -- Espresso Tips (Breville Bambino),Having owned it for a while I think having a 54mm portafilter affects the amount of coffee it can comfortably take. Unless you get a triple basket youll tend to find 14-16g is a comfortable fit and should get out up to 40g based on just pressing the double button as preset. I have done 18:40 but this would often lead to the puck over-expanding and sticking to the showerhead.  The Bambino is a great machine with some great features for the price I hope you have fun with it!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txu4pk/i_took_the_plunge_espresso_tips_breville_bambino/i3o96kc/'
i3p2546,2022-04-06 16:40:37,redsunstar,txu4pk,I Took the Plunge -- Espresso Tips (Breville Bambino),Random assortment of advice:  Pucks dont really have an optimal thickness but 18g can be a little too thick for a 54 mm basket Id start at 16g.   As usual weigh your outputs and stop the shot manually rather than rely on the machine.   For medium and lighter roasts a ratio of 1:3 or 1:2.5 at least is often more interesting than a straight 1:2.   For lighter roasts you should turbo shots (Both Lance Hedrick and Hoff have a video about it) are never a bad idea.   A circular paper filter at the bottom of the basket will bump up extraction yields and make the extraction more uniform.  If this tastes to acidic with lighter roasts consider the amount of buffer in your water. A 18:300 pourover has all the bicarbonates (buffer) contained in 300g of water. A 18:54 espresso has all the buffer contained in 54g of water six times less buffer.  Cheers.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txu4pk/i_took_the_plunge_espresso_tips_breville_bambino/i3p2546/'
i3odnrk,2022-04-06 13:50:37,Galbzilla,txu4pk,I Took the Plunge -- Espresso Tips (Breville Bambino),Awesome thank you. Would you split that 40g between two cups or is that just a single shot?,i3o96kc,/r/Coffee/comments/txu4pk/i_took_the_plunge_espresso_tips_breville_bambino/i3odnrk/'
i3oe62w,2022-04-06 13:53:49,raspberrythunder,txu4pk,I Took the Plunge -- Espresso Tips (Breville Bambino),Id say you could try it and see if the strength is good and if not you can make a double steam the milk for both and get then do a 2nd double. 20g of espresso is definitely a decent single!,i3odnrk,/r/Coffee/comments/txu4pk/i_took_the_plunge_espresso_tips_breville_bambino/i3oe62w/'

i3p2ugp,2022-04-06 16:46:04,esperalegant,txrqvy,I Tasted My First Coffee Notes,The way I think of this (and which helps me get over the pretentiousness) is that Im not literally trying to saying I taste apricot and honey when Im describing a coffee (or wine). Rather Im saying that the flavor reminds me of those.   Its because we lack many words for describing flavor in English (maybe in all languages). Bitter sour sweet salty umami and uh... thats about it.   So if we wanna go deeper than that we need to come up with some other words and the best we can do is to say it tastes a bit like apricots with a hint of chocolate or something like that. The alternative would be to invent loads of totally new words and that *really* would sound pretentious like *hmm this coffee is somewhat lastrucious little bit of babilion and just a hint of chocadoo on the back of the tongue*.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txrqvy/i_tasted_my_first_coffee_notes/i3p2ugp/'

Absolutely everything about this coffee gave off incredible blueberry notes - the scent the taste as both a brewed coffee and an espresso everything.

Theres loads of coffee beans used as decoration along one shelf some in bags some in bottles some roasted some unroasted. They are about 90% ok. All the ones in glass bottles totally fine (both roasted and unroasted).

i3mago0,2022-04-06 05:45:18,A_and_B_the_C_of_D,txl868,Moka Pot or AeroPress?,I started out making coffee with a moka pot and really liked it because it felt like an “activity” I could look forward to and practice dialing in but recently I’ve pretty much switched my daily brew to exclusively aeropress. It’s just a bit easier less finicky and more consistent overall. I follow James Hoffmann’s recipe for a concentrated brew to mix with milk not the standard one. Neither one is actually espresso (which you acknowledge) but I’m not sure if the moka pot technically gets closer since it’s under pressure. It certainly has a bit of different feel overall but because I’m mixing with milk I don’t notice a big difference.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txl868/moka_pot_or_aeropress/i3mago0/'
i3maqvr,2022-04-06 05:47:40,bmiller201,txl868,Moka Pot or AeroPress?,So moka pots are great but they have kind of a bit of a reload time it only makes the amount of coffee it makes no more no less. And clean up can be a bit tricky.   As for the aero press though it wont have as much body as a moka you can make as much or as little coffee as you want and if you need to make it in two batches clean up is a lot simpler.    The only other big deciding factor is how you feel about plastics the aeropress only comes in plastic and mokas only come in metal (mostly aluminum sometimes stainless).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txl868/moka_pot_or_aeropress/i3maqvr/'
i3mb3ui,2022-04-06 05:50:32,LEJ5512,txl868,Moka Pot or AeroPress?,Moka pot is basically as hassle-free as a drip machine IMO.  You dont even need to measure anything — load it by volume put it on med-low heat and thats it.  Its my daily driver.  Aeropress (I dont have one yet) has a lot more room for experimentation though.  Change the water-to-grounds ratio change the water temperature change the steep time (how long it sits before pushing the plunger) etc.  Its a little more hands-on than a moka pot but its also potentially faster.  (adding on) IMO you cant really go wrong with either one as I can spin them both to sound fun (moka = stress-free so a working barista can relax at home Aeropress = fun experimental hobby for a barista at home.  see? lol)  And theyre both cheap and they dont take up much space so theyll be easy to pack when you move.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txl868/moka_pot_or_aeropress/i3mb3ui/'

i3mcvqs,2022-04-06 06:04:41,Retax7,txkuvy,How to store coffee properly?,We produce 0 coffee so it comes from other countries. That means that we must pay a a real currency like USD. Our government misused all the reserves expropriated or sabotaged enterprises and professionals(like banning exportation even if they already had sold the product setting fake maximum prices taxing for 70% and imposing a dual currency system) so now there is no real money coming into my country. No money means we cant buy stuff from the other countries. We have shortages of everything now and then: sugar oil etcetc. It comes and go but I dont care much for sugar as I do for coffee. Sometimes is just a couple of weeks sometimes long months.  I wouldnt want to blame the current party but each time they are in power companies go broke and there are shortages so yeah fuck them.

i3mzm9p,2022-04-06 08:40:29,AHCFitness,txkf1x,Consistent 500ml Drippers,Glad to hear you’re getting great brews in an 02 with such a large dose!  I find agitation to be a double edge sword. On one hand it can be a challenge to get grounds near the bottom saturated during the bloom without some stirring/swirling (even with the divot). On the other hand it’s tough to be really consistent with it. I’ve noticed certain coffees (Ethiopian naturals especially) can go from a normal flow to choked very quickly with agitation presumably due to fines migration.,i3m9o2g,/r/Coffee/comments/txkf1x/consistent_500ml_drippers/i3mzm9p/'
i3mzwnu,2022-04-06 08:42:21,AHCFitness,txkf1x,Consistent 500ml Drippers,I’m the same way. I’ve collected (too many) drippers over the years and keep coming back to the 02. Just find the clarity of a good V60 brew to be unmatched.,i3man8g,/r/Coffee/comments/txkf1x/consistent_500ml_drippers/i3mzwnu/'

i3nfxh4,2022-04-06 10:23:13,Environmental_Cat670,txkf1x,Consistent 500ml Drippers,no not particularly - seating the filter and rinsing it carefully is pretty important to prevent the ridges from sticking together in the first place.    beyond that I dont pour particularly close to the edges.  I usually do a light handed bloom then on the first full pour Ill go around with a glass rod and push any clumps of grounds stuck in the ridges down into the water.  Very quick and prevents issues with high and dry grounds.  Those clumps dont tend to come back ime so I just continue my pours after that.  Ive never used a stagg but I think the sides are more vertical right?  I think with a kalita paper this would be trouble as yeah it would push the ruffles more towards the center exaggerating them unnecessarily and that doesnt look good in my imagination ),i3n28l1,/r/Coffee/comments/txkf1x/consistent_500ml_drippers/i3nfxh4/'

I know that the golden ratio is 1:16th which I think tastes delicious. But my room mate will drink that coffee but say its way too strong and keeps her too wired. So I know the coffee for her needs to be weaker. Would the flavor be better if I reduced the ratio or watered down the coffee post brew.   Like for example lets say were using the 350g of water at 20g of coffee.   The end goal would be 350g of water.   I can maintain 350g of water by brewing 175g of water with 10g of coffee then pour in the remainder of water to top off the mug.   Alternatively I can just straight brew the 350g of water with 10g of coffee from the start.  I imagine both ways would have entirely different flavor profiles but what would be the best for what Im trying to do. Would either produce more caffeine? It may come down to me just trying both ways and seeing what works.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tximg1/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3oabgy/'

Percolation methods will be different and you need to bloom your coffee not only to release CO2 gasses but also to saturate the coffee to promote evenness and prevent water channeling in brewing. Also the blooming phase helps open up the pores on the cell walls of the coffee thus allowing the flavor molecules and soluble solids to be easily captured by the water as it ends up in your cup/server.,i3lyn8l,/r/Coffee/comments/tximg1/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3meiug/'
i3mk3z7,2022-04-06 06:57:44,yahat,tximg1,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,For filter when you bloom youre essentially just wetting the grinds to release CO2.  There should only be the tiniest bit of liquid in your carafe.  If you didnt bloom with filter you would start producing coffee that hasnt bloomed the coffee would come out unbalanced with a sourness imparted.  French Press is like one big bloom for all intensive purposes even though you technically are not performing a bloom you arent filtering out that coffee yet either.  *edited for clarity,i3lyn8l,/r/Coffee/comments/tximg1/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3mk3z7/'

i3mtera,2022-04-06 08:00:10,VibrantCoffee,tximg1,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,What youre saying is kind of true but it is misleading for anyone else reading this. The first bits of liquid that fall into the carafe are always going to be very sour and very strong regardless of whether or not you bloom the coffee.  If you dont bloom the coffee you will likely have an uneven and low overall extraction because you didnt get the grounds all wet before having lots of water flow through them and you didnt soften up the cell structure and all that. An uneven and low extraction will be sour and will probably have some astringency too.  So it isnt really right to just say that you bloom to make the first bits not unpleasant. They are always unpleasant if tasted on their own. They contribute to a nice-tasting balanced coffee IF the rest of your extraction is good and making the rest of your extraction good is the entire point of blooming.,i3mqd8x,/r/Coffee/comments/tximg1/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3mtera/'

If you do it properly the same flavours extract at the same early and late points in the brew and your brew covers all the same points regardless how youve scaled it.   While its arguably *hard* to get the same extraction across different ratios - I disagree but regardless - user error is not treated as fact within how extraction functions on a chemical level.  You extract the same compounds and you have the same number of them relative to the water you have the same two cups.  If you extract different compounds or different ratios of those compounds across those two cups - that is user error.    No the point of using ratios is to adjust concentration. Nothing more.  You use your brew time and grind size to adjust your extraction window and thus cup tastes.  Ratio solely should govern how much taste is in your cup not which taste.,i3pkrip,/r/Coffee/comments/tximg1/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3pm4gt/'

i3py0t2,2022-04-06 20:50:57,Anomander,tximg1,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Im not convinced youre genuinely following what Im presenting.  The things youre asking me to explain and defend arent represented in what Ive said.  If we know the same facts about extraction its not that Ive got it wrong but that youre trying to apply what Ive said to what you know in ways that are not consistent with how extraction works and might be asking the wrong questions.     >If I divided a coffee bean into equal weights of different compounds then dissolved those in water they would have the same TDS but be entirely different drinks.  So sure.  But is that what were doing here?  If you think about it splitting up the bean into components isnt what is being discussed here.  From that modelling the actual question would be: if you took all those parts and mixed them together with 100ml of water would that taste the same as mixing them with 50ml of water then adding another 50ml?  The answer to that question is yes.    It doesnt matter if the caffeine takes 12 seconds to extract and the lipids take two minutes while the acids take 47 seconds ... if your brew is 2:30 in both cases.[*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/tximg1/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3py0t2/ Hypothetically speaking for the sake of example.)    You still get to the same place at the same pace each time.  Changing ratio adds physical challenges that make getting the same extraction across the two brews more challenging than a simple numerical change but thats a user input factor not a function of extraction itself.    The chemistry of what is available in the bean is a fixed point and how it will respond is likewise fixed - all you can change is the stimulus.  What that means is that you also *cant avoid* extracting the acids at 47 seconds.  You arent going to miss something or change the overall balance of what you get in the cup outside of the equally-fixed parameters of extraction you cant extract more sugars and less acids by doing things X way or avoid the chocolate notes by extracting this other note instead - if chemistry says you get the acids at 47 seconds you get the acids.  Now you can fake this by hedging towards underextraction - you can stop at your brews 1:55 and only get *some* of the lipids and produce a brighter and cleaner tasting cup but less balanced.  Ideal extraction is best modelled as a range not a single fixed point.    The only compounds you can - sort of - opt out of is overextraction the tannins[*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/tximg1/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3py0t2/ Not technically tannins but everyone calls them that so lets just keep using the word coffee people know & understand even if it drives the chemists nuts.) require highly turbulent flow to extract and if you avoid channeling you can dodge the bulk of tannic bitterness.  This is how ideal extractions are approximately defined - extracting as much as possible without also extracting tannins typically at 19-23% of total mass though some folks with exceptional setups and patience have reportedly gone as high as 28%.,i3pokek,/r/Coffee/comments/tximg1/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3py0t2/'

It all depends on what type of coffee you like.   My espresso journey: I went for a low spec delonghi espresso machine which had a milk frother. Then a blade grinder (before I knew that theyre not good at all). I upgraded to a hand grinder which was much better one with a ceramic burr. My final upgrade was actually last week where I got a Sage Bambino Plus which has completely opened up a new pathway into flavours and variations in extraction.   Drip/pour over journey: I had for years enjoyed a French press but wanted to try more variations of brewing. I got a v60 and a scale (to 0.1 of a gram) which was very difficult to get right but also taught me a lot about dosing and brew temperatures. Then I got an aeropress. The aeropress is by far my favourite brewing method as its very difficult to get wrong. It allows you to make an excellent cup of coffee with low effort and in a short time.   If you havent seen him already but James Hoffman on YouTube is an excellent starting point to see what coffee has to offer and the multitude of variations it can be brewed.

This is because the coffee you get from it is consistently fantastic. Its so smooth you can actually drink it without milk and it tastes as it it has milk in it.

Turns mediocre beans into drinkable. So much better than any capsule or k cup.,i3veeex,/r/Coffee/comments/txignv/im_drinking_coffee_since_16_or_17_years_how_do_i/i3w04u7/'

i3lxz5r,2022-04-06 03:41:44,MuTangClan,txhvqa,Sour Hipster Coffee?,Italian and Vienna roasts are old schools/2nd wave (and dark roasts at that!) compared to what all the hip/hipster/modern cafes will (probably) be doing. Looking for darker roasts will probably be your best bet. One way to ask/look for this at a snooty hipster shop or a coffee geek place without rubbing people the wrong way would be to ask about their more/most developed roasts or about their beans that are roasted for espresso. If that still aint good for you you can say hey thanks for this but then ask about places with a more traditional profile - they might point you in the direction of a shop thats doing things a little more classically,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txhvqa/sour_hipster_coffee/i3lxz5r/'

And yes alot of the coffee is is supposed to be fruity aka sour in a good way.   To find coffee you like look for tasting notes that say caramel toffee toast coca chocolatey nutty cereal etc.   Avoid coffees with notes of fruit berry citrus wine fermented etc.  Also if youre drinking espresso/americanos. Light roasts are notoriously hard to pull a good shot. Maybe try some pour overs if youre gonna go for specialty.

i3lxxwd,2022-04-06 03:41:18,NotNotes55,txhvqa,Sour Hipster Coffee?,No need to apologise. YouTube is good. Guys like James Hoffmann are good starting points.  But ultimately its just about taste. Need to just try stuff and experiment to find what works for you. Unfortunately no shortcuts.  When i used to serve light roast coffee to rusted on dark roast drinkers they would often perceive acidity as sourness.,i3lxpqs,/r/Coffee/comments/txhvqa/sour_hipster_coffee/i3lxxwd/'
i3m40ki,2022-04-06 04:47:43,Dear-War-9159,txhvqa,Sour Hipster Coffee?,there is a large spectrum of flavor profiles. Most coffee shops do a great job of dressing themselves up to look like a hip place but the beans they use are pre-roasted and probably not top quality. Every business owner needs to decide if they want to bring quality to the counter or just something that blends well with the variety of milk products that so many people are clamoring for. Do you sell what you think people like or try to expose them to new things?  I always look for independently owned/operated coffee shops anywhere I travel (Ive been to parts some large cities in Canada and areas far outside big places London Amsterdam numerous cities in Mexico and probably 40 states of the US) And seriously I have often been disappointed most places brew all their roasts with the same method never vary temperature of the water. That is a problem because different varieties of beans will produce a much better cup at different temps or with different brew methods. SO take in a lot of factors.  AS for Sour maybe higher acidity which is described as a bright taste maybe to you this is sour?   Also our tastes may shift or sometimes we need time to gradually take in a new thing. And then sometimes what we were told is amazing just tastes weird to us as individuals.  I once bought 8 ounces of beans from Yemen super expensive and it didnt matter what grind size I used aeropress or pour over 175f-185f-195f it just didnt tickle my fancy. But you pay to learn these things sometimes.  Keep hunting for your beans or the shop that makes it right for your taste :),i3lxpqs,/r/Coffee/comments/txhvqa/sour_hipster_coffee/i3m40ki/'
i3m0tpa,2022-04-06 04:14:40,MuTangClan,txhvqa,Sour Hipster Coffee?,Im sure youll be able to find some more old schools type places in a place like London (big city) it just probably wont be the cafes making the top ten lists on Eater this month or whatever. The newest and trendiest are doing something different entirely.  You might try a long-time local favorite instead maybe in a neighborhood that is currently or was historically high in immigrant population as they might have preserved more of those taste preferences for their regulars. Like if theres an Italian quarter or something but doesnt have to be Italian specifically - my experience (in US) of things like Cuban Arab/Turkish etc coffee is they lean much closer to what youre looking for than the newest cute Scandi minimalist cafe.,i3lz4d4,/r/Coffee/comments/txhvqa/sour_hipster_coffee/i3m0tpa/'

i3m7xwm,2022-04-06 05:24:04,_sawas_,txhvqa,Sour Hipster Coffee?,If you found both Espresso and Americano (which is more diluted) to be too acidic for you then it is probably a matter of taste.   Italian-style coffee is usually roasted darker and can be a blend between Arabica and Robusta. It rarely has any acidity to it but can be really bitter.  On the other hand the coffee shops you visited are focused on medium-light roasts to emphasise the coffee flavour associated with the coffee variety/origin etc. It is common for that coffee to taste fruity/acidic and if under-extracted it can also be overwhelmingly sour.  It would not be overwhelming in an Americano though unless if you really dislike acidity in coffee.   I had a similar question years ago but it was because I actually liked what I perceived as sour and wanted to find more.   My advice to you is avoid the hipster places. The good news is that there are a tonne traditional coffee places/chains that serve exactly the coffee style you prefer. Colombia/Brazil and South Asia typically produce coffee catering to traditional tastes.,i3lxrf2,/r/Coffee/comments/txhvqa/sour_hipster_coffee/i3m7xwm/'

Just grind straight into a portafilter with a dosing ring on it and you’re good. No need for RDT or anything and the only mod I did was cutting out one of the flaps for a better flow.  The coffee it produces is clear and bright in taste. Haven’t tried a Niche personally but it’s supposed to be more bodied and round in flavor. A matter of preference.

In a busy cafe its a life and death kind of thing - you absolutely have to have the fastest easiest most consistent workflow possible. But to make a drink or three at home? Whats an extra few seconds or having to pay a tiny bit more attention to what youre doing? Id make your choice solely based on flavor in the cup.

i3lu43q,2022-04-06 02:51:46,MikeTheBlueCow,txgb97,Niche or DF64,I have a Niche and just got a DF64 with SSP MP burrs. I got the DF64 specifically because I am tired of the poor results with pour overs and light roasts with the Niche. I was using my hand grinder for pour overs rather than the Niche so the DF64 is just to upgrade that workflow for me. I havent been able to do a direct head to head comparison yet since the SSP burrs are still seasoning but it is clearly capable of a much brighter cup with better clarity vs the Niche. (Im not totally knocking on the Niche here- Im still deciding if I want to keep it for when I do darker roasts and whether I prefer it for espresso or not. My only significant problem with the Niche is covering up what I consider the best part of light roasts for pour over).  Honestly if you want chocolatey textured espresso *and* brightness and clarity with light roasts you just dont get that with a single grinder solution. You end up having to prioritize one or get two grinders and that should be the largest justification for the purchase *IMO*. The issues I have with the DF64 are no greater than I had with the Niche when I first got it (high static and retention) and as those calmed down in the Niche I started to pay less attention to the workflow. It will likely be the same with the DF64 the only question is if you *have* to mod it to achieve better static and retention control or if that will resolve on its own.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txgb97/niche_or_df64/i3lu43q/'

I currently have a lagom mini on preorder as I use a flair for espresso so my grinds for espresso are much coarser than a 58mm basket (supposedly very fine grinds stall the lagom mini). If I had a 58mm setup I’d probs go for a DF64.

I ultimately chose this because I wanted something decent looking quiet and able to switch between espresso and drip. I also appreciate that the niche is well designed and deals with retention elegantly. The DF64 bellows solution just seems hacky. Taste wise I’ve never owned flat burrs so I can’t comment there but I will say that the ease of switching is excellent and the espresso has been really enjoyable. I’ve gotten some very good filter coffee from it though I have needed to change my technique to accommodate the grinder’s production of fines. [The Wired Goirmet’s v60 video](https://youtu.be/hyHAOkH2tMY) has some good information on accommodating for the Niche. I don’t necessarily buy everything he says in this video but I’ve had good results with his method and my Niche.

i3mh7v4,2022-04-06 06:37:03,raven737,txgb97,Niche or DF64,Wanted to get a Niche Zero but price in the EU is now about 900 EUR (after paying VAT + fees on top of the 599 GBP). So instead I got a DF64 and a Comandante C40 MK4.  I am super happy. I use the Comandante for my favorite darker roast to make creamy/rich/textured shots and the DF64 for all the light roasted single origin coffees where I want a clear fruity spicy taste. Really glad to have two good grinders less adjusting and I have both flat and conical burrs for less than the price of one Niche Zero.  The DF64 is bit of work to setup though. I removed the clump flaps completely within the first hour of unpacking and its a bit of a pain to disassemble to get to the flaps. Then aligning the burrs is very important but also takes a long time: Important note make sure each of the 3 springs is fully/properly seated with the sleeve all the way at the bottom! Once aligned and working it really gives great results. The design of the burr adjustment is in my opinion really good. There is no risk of the adjustment creeping with use and the top burr does not rotate when adjusting (so no risk of alignment changes due to turning the stationary burr).  Edit about DF64: On button placement and style is annoying (pressing a flush round button at the base right below the opening is less than ideal). However I am not yet annoyed enough to disassemble it again and install a proper lever style button on the side.  Edit2: Static is HORRIBLE after removing the clump flaps unless you use a spray bottle. Then it goes from horrible to non existent.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txgb97/niche_or_df64/i3mh7v4/'

The one thing I’ll say is that make sure you purchase it from a vendor with a return policy. The only such place I could get one was Amazon so I did that. And unfortunately I had to return it. The grind adjust kept tightening on me such that I couldn’t dial it back down to zero after grinding at a coarser level.  Of course this is anecdotal and most others here seem happy with their grinders. What I did get out of it in terms if the grind quality I liked.

Negative comments about the workflow are definitely a large part of what’s holding me back from going for it. Particularly encouraging that you don’t have to RDT as I’ve seen others have bad static issues - I know so many people RDT but it somewhat bothers me doing something that manufacturers advise against (from what I’ve read though probably differs grinder to grinder)   I love the idea of clear and bright in taste particularly considering Ive leant towards fruity medium/light roast coffee with filter. Would you say that the DF64 is limited to exclusively lighter bodied bright cups? With the right bean/ brewing method do you think you could get a fuller bodied richer profile?

i3me2ud,2022-04-06 06:13:55,biod3rma,txg8f6,Help with moka pot sputtering,I think no one here has picked up that youre using a Brikka. That model of Moka pot has a small valve that creates a bit of extra pressure in the brewing chamber and then releases it all at once which is why it looks like its sputtering from the start which is absolutely correct. Nothing from Hoffmans Moka pot video applies.   I have found that grinding medium fine is about right. I dont tamp as well. Just level it off (my 2 cup brikka takes about 13-15grams. I start with room temp water and let it heat up on high heat. Do not follow Hoffmans advice for water because it is not applicable for the Brikka. The pot at the top has a mark that you fill to and then u pour that water into the brew chamber at the bottom. U can measure roughly how much water that is (in my case it was about 90gms of water). As soon as the valve engages I take it off the heat and then pop it on a cool towel. Then pour out. I usually get around 60gms of coffee so roughly 1:4.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txg8f6/help_with_moka_pot_sputtering/i3me2ud/'
i3lk5uq,2022-04-06 00:30:35,ankris14,txg8f6,Help with moka pot sputtering,Have you tried grinding a bit coarser?

i3meloo,2022-04-06 06:17:51,Safe-Tank-6681,txg8f6,Help with moka pot sputtering,Hi my native language isnt english so its hard for me to understand what you mean by sputtering. In the brikka model the coffee always burst fast to the upper chamber because of the little weight that sit on top of the opening. This is normal. If by sputtering you mean that coffee squirt from the upper chamber outside its because you didnt cooled down the lower chamber fast enough. When coffee burst out you need to wait 2-3 seconds and than immediately put your moka pot a bit tilted under cold tap water (with out letting the water get to your coffee).this will stop the brewing process. Another thing to do when brewing on moka pot is to use a flame that will not be bigger than the base. The best for moka pot is to use the butan camping gas stoves cause the flame radius is small but concentraded. Sorry for my english. Hope this helps,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txg8f6/help_with_moka_pot_sputtering/i3meloo/'

No more than the valve and only a little below. This is important because pressure.  Use medium-fine grind. That is not espresso fine powder.  NEVER tamp the coffee. Run your finger through the top of the funnel to make sure that part isnt full mountains of coffee are bad. It is better to have less coffee than too much coffee. I believe this might be your mistake the funnel and the tube get clogged and after a long time sputters violently. It happened to me once when learning.  Use hot water in the lower part. No one recommends this but is is both much faster and you dont really loose taste. Put 60-70 degree water in the part at the bottom.  &#x200B  That is all I can think of right now good luck and let me know if it worked.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txg8f6/help_with_moka_pot_sputtering/i3m5zpb/'

It can still be used to make teapots but still requires energy to maintain its temperature.    Heating water takes an extreme amount of energy no matter the source (electricity fuel like gas etc.) so finding a heater/boiler that uses less than 300 watts seems counterintuitive when most use 800W or above.   You might be better with either: Asian style boiler/warmer so you have hot water at the ready OR just getting a higher wattage kettle that will heat up your water in no time.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txg84l/highcapacity_lowpower_electric_kettle/i3lm19w/'

i3lxhpn,2022-04-06 03:35:44,Shteevie,txg84l,High-capacity low-power electric kettle?,When heating water one issue is that water will evaporate even at room temp which will cool it down. If you are adding energy to it to heat it up you will increase this evaporation rate.  Son in effect the process of heating water requires you to add more energy to it than is lost through evaporation and radiation and to do so at a rate that will increase the temp of the body of water to the desired point before it all cools or evaporates away.  Additionally water heating is almost never done in a sealed environment since steam pressure will build and create a potentially explosive situation.  In almost all water heating scenarios the desire is for hot water to be achieved as fast as possible meaning that all of these devices are designed to pump as much energy into the water as safely possible in a short amount of time. Slowly heating water over a long time in order to reach high temps is really inefficient since a larger portion of that water will have evaporated you will end up using more energy in total by heating slowly for a long time to get to the same temperature.  To put it plainly I doubt there is a product that does what you are looking for.  If all you want to do is make tea while minimizing energy use I would recommend Sun Tea or using residual heat from cooking to heat your water in small quantities.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txg84l/highcapacity_lowpower_electric_kettle/i3lxhpn/'

i3m91zz,2022-04-06 05:33:38,Wizzerzak,txg0wy,water question again for UK,Its very possible you already have pretty much perfect water for coffee. 27.1 mg/l calcium is equivalent to 67.75 mg/l as calcium carbonate. I also checked the latest [water report pdf](http://www.ywsonline.co.uk/web/WQZ.nsf/0/0F8B947A01B9495880258806003ACAE6/$file/Graincliffe%202004%20WSZ.002.pdf) and the mean values are actually a bit lower than that at a total hardness of 22.28 or 55.7 mg/l as calcium carbonate. This puts you somewhere in [this zone I painted orange](https://i.imgur.com/OjKc0I8.png).  However as you may notice this is only half the story and you also need to know the alkalinity or carbonate hardness (KH) of your water. Too much/little KH and youll struggle to find the right balance of acidity in your cup. Unfortunately your water company does not report alkalinity (as commented a few times on [this thread](https://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6494&start=60) I found I guess 12 years later and they still dont do this!). Total hardness and alkalinity *usually* go hand in hand however so Id expect your alkalinity to be somewhere between 30 and 70 mg/l. Your only option to know for sure is to grab a GH/KH test kit.  If youre interested in reading more I wrote a detailed post 6 months ago on this exact topic from a UK perspective.

Before buying a filter Id recommend buying some bottled water. Brew two coffees one with the tap and one with the bottle. Do you notice a major difference? Do you much prefer one to the other?   I think a lot of people get caught up on the concept of making the perfect coffee (and this is indeed part of the fun) but many of the changes are very and so incremental that they barely make a difference. The sum of all the little things makes a great cup of coffee but give it a go with some bottled water and see if you can notice a difference.

The convenience of having both components produces lower quality - not to say that they aren’t great but when entering the rabbit hole there is something always better.

i3lom8g,2022-04-06 01:33:34,esperalegant,txb87h,Does anyone own a Delonghi all in one?,Quick suggestion - if youre asking for advice on a product make it easy for people and include a link to the exact product on Amazon or the manufacturers website.   Anyway there seems to be quite a few reviews for this machine on youtube for example:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f09DCruUTD4  One thing is that it looks like it doesnt include a grinder so its not really all in one. When youre starting out the grinder is the first thing to consider. Theres no point getting an espresso machine unless you have a grinder - unless you live right next door to a cafe and can get them to grind fresh for you or something. The espresso grind from a supermarket wont work in a real espresso machine in my experience. Part of the deal with making espresso is that for each bean you need to experiment with the grind size and make it work with your espresso machine especially when its a cheap machine and might not have perfect pressure/temperature.   If you dont already have a grinder the Breville Barista Express with the grinder built in gets good reviews and is a good price when you compare it to buying the machine and grinder separately.   If you want to make normal coffee as well I would suggest getting a v60/aeropress/french press or something like that - or even all three they are quite cheap and you can experiment with them.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/txb87h/does_anyone_own_a_delonghi_all_in_one/i3lom8g/'

Try to find a local roaster ask them to make a cup of coffee for you using your method as they make it ask them questions. Also ask for the best bean/roast for that maker.  Be sure to pop in and ask when a good time to ask questions might be. A good roaster will want to boast about their origins and roasting process.  Try not to limit your palate to darker roasts because of the stronger flavor the light/medium roasts offer an experience in flavor and extraction you will learn to enjoy.  If you have few local roasters try some good smaller operations in different regions. Some offer subscriptions sample packs trial periods. Be open to new things.

Their customer support is really good too. They will help with any issues you might have. Some might suggest a hand grinder for better quality-to-price ratio. I did hand grinding for a little while and got real sick of the manual labor.   I would suggest that you explore as many different coffees as you can. Peets tends to roast most of their coffees quite dark and that can mask most of the unique characteristics of the coffees origin for the sake of consistency between batches. Local craft roasters will tend to offer lighter roasts that preserve those flavors better highlighting the natural qualities of the crop. Let your own preferences and curiosities guide you when it comes to choosing your next bag (most craft roasters will have flavor notes printed on the bag).   I will say that your chosen equipment is better suited to brewing roasts on the lighter end of the spectrum as pour-over methods tend to bring more clarity of flavor due to the paper filtering out oils and sediment. Chemex filters are especially good at that thanks to their thickness.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tx9lxc/just_getting_into_coffee_any_tips/i3kijw3/'

A pack is about 15 bucks and with daily drinking it takes me a couple months to go through it. So worth it to me. Water is easily the most overlooked variable in coffee IMO.  Beyond that I would keep your water at boiling and only adjust one other variable at a time. (Ratio or grind). I’ve got a Fellow Stag EKG and almost always just boil my water anyway lol.

Ideally I’d install a reverse osmosis system at home (apparently not that difficult) that way I’m not tearing through plastic. You could also find a place to just refill jugs you already have to get around single use plastic. (Make sure it’s distilled or reverse osmosis)  I also just use hot tap water for rinsing filters/preheating to conserve the Third Wave Water. Plastic Aeropress and V60 come in handy there as they insulate best and require little to no preheating.,i3n6kmd,/r/Coffee/comments/tx71bn/best_method_for_getting_acidity_to_shine/i3nerpw/'

I stayed with Eureka for ease of operation quality and the larger burr set on the XL. However foot print was also important to me so it  precluded the choice of a larger grinder.

Its on the cheaper side and needed some modifications to make the coffee really good (it comes with a pressurized basket that makes a fake crema for example and I had to buy a bottomless portafilter and work on finding the perfect grind size).   The problem is I use a manual grinder and even though its supposed to be one of the fastest for its size it still takes ages at least because I find that the coffee grind size has to be very very fine for it to work in my machine. For 17g of coffee Im putting in in excess of 5 minutes of grinding lol. Just too much.   So I started my research on an electric grinder and anything decent I find is actually way more expensive than the espresso machine!   So can someone here maybe recommend something decent thats on the cheaper side and also has a smaller footprint? I dont want something gigantic on my countertop. Thanks.   PS. I live in Spain and over here everything seems more expensive (comparing amazon.com to amazon.es... for example Brevilles Smart Grinder Pro is around 150USD in the states around 250 euros or 280 USD on amazon.es),-,/r/Coffee/comments/twree7/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3jptvp/'

I want good coffee but Im worried that not only will I be wasting resources but it may be a while before I can press a good shot. 3.

Its not a snob thing its just how things are - proper esspresso making requires a proper grinder which is on the more expensive side. I too had trouble coming into terms with this some 6 months ago when i started researching home espresso making. If you are enjoying espresso and the process of making espresso it might be wise to save up  bite the bullet and get a grinder that will last you years if taken care of properly.

More immersion-style methods like French press Vietnamese phin AeroPress etc. and brewing at a much stronger ratio (use less water) and cooler water will generally net you better (smoother less bitter less rubbery) taste,i3h1jq8,/r/Coffee/comments/twree7/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3ia1sx/'

To make it just dissolve equal weight sugar to water (ex. 100g sugar and 100mL water). You can stir for a long time at room temp or microwave for a min or so and then stir till the solution is clear. This can be stored in the fridge so that its the right temp and it is stable  (will not cause the sugar to crash out of solution).,i3h2a5g,/r/Coffee/comments/twree7/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3jy5qg/'

Just remember that to get an actual espresso machine you will probably also need a decent grinder that might have similar cost to the machine itself.   I am not a mainly espresso guy so my very cheap and basic set up is a 1Zpresso jx-pro grinder  with a Breville Bambino which works out to about 550\~600CAD.

i3ic6tz,2022-04-05 09:36:43,Anomander,twree7,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,1.  Its hard to *quantify* how much worse especially given the range of possible experiences but I am comfy saying significantly.  Even at the absolute top end of possible performance which is not realistic for home day-to-day experience its a challenge to get a superauto to put out a shot Id assess as pretty good for all that theyre completely acceptable as latte-fill and better than a Nespresso.   2. Sort of.  Like theres a lot to learn and a lot to pick up but its very fast to get the basics and get to a place youre pulling allright shots - its only going past that into fine-tuning that tends to get more and more prohibitive.   3. What kind of pods?  A typical user experience on a superauto is IMO on par or slightly above Nespresso but can lag behind something like an ESE if theyre relatively fresh.  The issue with Superauto is that theyre not really *super* automatic but instead that theyre mechanically consistent - the user is still responsible for calibration which means you get a wide range of user-reported experiences.,i3i2grg,/r/Coffee/comments/twree7/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3ic6tz/'
i3lmfd3,2022-04-06 01:02:21,yahat,twree7,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,There is a learning curve but once youre past it well youre past it.  Of course theres always something to learn.  However Ill say youll want to use it at least a couple times everyday.  Youll go through 1-3 shots dialling in espresso every morning think of throwing that away for every shot you pull in the morning.  You wont need to redial later on like they do in commercial environments but the coffee is always oxidizing and every day its different.  If you drink a lot of coffee go for it.  If not Id say youd get better bang for your buck Id go with anything coarser than espresso.  Stovetop filter immersion etc.  Just be mentally prepared for the extra coffee cost and dialling in for spros basically.  Id say its worth it.,i3i2grg,/r/Coffee/comments/twree7/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3lmfd3/'

This is really up to your preference and what works well enough in the machine.   > or roughly 2 tablespoons  Honestly the weight of coffee varies so much that if youre using 2 tablespoons as a measure you really arent sure the gram amount youre using anyways. Youll need to adjust grind size or amount of coffee pretty regularly.  >Should you always toss the grounds after a single brew? I think you are but Ive known people to re-use them.

Using them twice results in a very weak brew with much less caffeine that doesnt taste nearly the same.  >Is there any calculator or information on what the average amount of caffeine is within 16 grams of coffee grounds?

i3jw8v4,2022-04-05 15:43:43,MuTangClan,twree7,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Mason jars filled to the top and sealed up will keep in the freezer almost indefinitely without issue. Just be sure to either bring the whole jar to room temp before re-opening (best practice) or open/dose/reseal quickly (i do this with most stuff if I know Im going to go through it fast enough and weather conditions are ok for it aka not hot/humid). The main thing youre trying to avoid is getting condensation on the beans when theyre coming up to room temp so youre not introducing moisture. Kept dry and cold (and esp airtight) the roasted beans will keep for a very long time (like 1-2 years long).  I do this if I went on a spree and have too many different beans to consume in a month - freeze majority of a couple bags and leave a couple hundred grams of each out so i can rotate between in the coming month.

I really want to start enjoying coffee for what it is and not have to rely on a bunch of additives to get a decent flavor.   As for machines I’m tossed up between a Bambino Plus and a Rancilio Silvia v6. I know most beginners go for the Gaggia classic but I don’t feel comfortable enough to install a PID.  I still however need to do some research on grinders.

i3mtkz5,2022-04-06 08:01:18,yahat,twree7,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I mean yes and no.  With every new bag and typically you wont be buying from the same batch you will have to dial from scratch.  Maybe thats less of a process of youre buying the same coffee again and again once youre familiar you have an understanding of what parameters generally make that coffee happy.  If youre buying a different kind of coffee often youll go through more coffee dialling in since youll be starting fresh each time.  Now with a bag beans youre using for the next two weeks or so (whatever time period youre using it) itll just be the first dial that you go through the most coffee.  With a brand new machine and grinder you might go through a bag the first time and after that you definitely wont go through a bag again even for different coffees.  However regular use strictly speaking 1-3 shots dialling a day at home.  Think if youre having four cups of coffee a day you might be drinking more than what you used to dial.  If youre having one or two a day it might be on par to dialling in.  Youll find that the coffee is degassing a lot in that first week (that first week being at least seven days off roast so the seven to fourteen day period).  Youll dial a lot because the coffee is going to change significantly by the next day.  However after that week the coffee will stabilize and wont be releasing as much CO2 you wont notice extreme changes day to day and occasionally you might be happy with your first shot.  Youll definitely save a lot of money after that initial setting up cost and I think even with tossing a shot or two each day youll save more than buying it from a cafe thats for sure.,i3mrjun,/r/Coffee/comments/twree7/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3mtkz5/'

Bambino I hear heats up super fast and is jam-packed with features.  The Silvia is commercial grade material Rancilio does manufacture a lot of commercial machines and is a lot simpler in functionality.  It will take longer to warm up like most commercial machines but the Silvia will last you forever where the Bambino will most certainly not.  Higher learning curve on the Silvia due to lack of automation but perhaps fun if you like to challenge yourself.,i3nrr39,/r/Coffee/comments/twree7/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3u8ksz/'

Heres the info I posted on another similar post (did you double post?). It might help if theres a different audience here.  ---  This is more about filtering for espresso but it covers the basics of filtration really well. https://www.talkcoffee.com.au/education/filtration/  I assume youve tested with an API GH/KH test kit and potentially a TDS kit too?  A filter such as the one listed under heading 6 of the previous link should do the job it covers the caveats/cut-offs for TDS limits.  Here are some similar systems: https://www.psifilters.com.au/60-premium-countertop-range (datasheets will tell you the GH/KH range they can filter at)  If your water is beyond fkd you can get a RO system regardless of where you live: https://www.psifilters.com.au/standard-countertop-range/10004-1672672-4-stage-countertop-reverse-osmosis-system.html#/  and remin for espresso: https://www.home-barista.com/water/easiest-way-to-make-rpavlis-water-t64609.html  or filter: https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/diy-water-recipes-redux/  Yes ive mostly posted Australian links. This is because I have used their systems (the RO system in a house with terrible pipes) but mostly because they use filters made in Western countries with datasheets in *most* of their systems. So you can find equivalents easily.  Ive linked the easy to install/renter friendly options.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/twp5a6/i_am_a_beginner_and_i_finally_figured_out_why_my/i3gz19b/'

Boiling water kills bacteria in it. The minerals are unaffected. Those minerals are what contribute to flavor.  Its also why pure distilled water is not good. You want some good minerals in your water to maximize taste. Some people here even make their own water by adding specific amounts of minerals to distilled water.  Also once you realize that any coffee no matter how strong is still somewhere over 90% water (I forget the value) you realize how obvious water quality is to the final product.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/twp5a6/i_am_a_beginner_and_i_finally_figured_out_why_my/i3ji10j/'

i510302,2022-04-16 18:09:45,Way-Famous,twp5a6,I am a beginner and I finally figured out why my coffee always turned out bitter - its the goddamn tap water,Water can be even crazier than that ... heres one coffee and one non coffee story:  1. Inexpensive major brand two mug drip machine with thermos. At home great. At work the first mug out of the thermos is just like home... great! However the 2nd mug poured out of the thermos about 20 minutes later is horrible. I tried decanting the 2nd mug early so it wasnt sitting in the thermos... no change the 2nd mug was still undrinkable. Tried a different coffee machine (borrowed) with MY thermos tasted great. Tried my machine and thermos with my own water... tasted great. So the combination of that drip machine PLUS that particular tap water PLUS several minutes of time for the chemistry to settle was the killer. 2. I had a fresh water fish tank. Every week or two I changed water and adjusted the pH. Killed a few fish. One day after adjusting the new waters pH I stalled a few hours and checked the pH just to be safe itd drifted significantly. Adjusted again waited a couple of hours it drifted again adjusted again and finally after several hours it was stable. The Fish Store owner said I was crazy... two years later I was in his store and he was telling someone dont use West Acton (MA) water theres something weird going on there... I was vindicated. Again it wasnt just the combination there was an elapsed time contributor to the problem.  I should ask George Howell (his roastery is on the East side of Acton Im on the West side) what water he uses for tastings at the roastery. Acton has several wells and depending on which part of town youre in and what day it is you may be getting a different mix of well waters. I keep a 5 gal Poland Springs for coffee just to minimize the variations I would otherwise have no control over.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/twp5a6/i_am_a_beginner_and_i_finally_figured_out_why_my/i510302/'

You can add a bit more Ca to adjust bitterness if you want too.,i3k0idt,/r/Coffee/comments/twp5a6/i_am_a_beginner_and_i_finally_figured_out_why_my/i3kl8or/'

Some Brita filters actually soften the water somewhat. Even the ones that dont are removing all kinds of sediment/chlorine/etc that has a negative impact on how your coffee tastes.

The reason we want magnesium and calcium ions specifically in our brew (or espresso) water is to help extract desirable flavor compounds from the coffee grounds. Water alone struggles to pull all of these compounds out. This has nothing to do with whether minerals or other compounds are getting released from the coffee itself...  The absolute perfect water for brew will be different than the absolute perfect water for espresso purely from an extraction standpoint because of the additional pressure with espresso. But you still dont want super soft (I am talking general hardness/Ca/Mg - a lot of people in this thread are using soft very loosely) water for espresso.,i3k5mik,/r/Coffee/comments/twp5a6/i_am_a_beginner_and_i_finally_figured_out_why_my/i3k6he3/'

Magnesium and Calcium are the two major minerals the sodium is just a buffer that reduces perceptual bitterness when occurring within its ideal range - though many other minerals do also play their own roles in either extraction or end solution taste.  This is why water recipes never *fully* recreate so-called local waters brewing parameters.   While - if youre adding +10 to a 0 thats a different outcome than adding +10 to a 2.  Water that tastes pretty empty is not almost distilled - its not actually empty.  Its probably several orders of magnitude away from being actually empty because running water *even close to* that pure through city pipes would ensure that its not still that pure when it gets to your faucet - we dont push distilled through civic pipes because itll leech mineral content from what you put it into when its that empty.,i3hq4s1,/r/Coffee/comments/twp5a6/i_am_a_beginner_and_i_finally_figured_out_why_my/i3isrvv/'

i3ge6vi,2022-04-04 22:24:45,One_Left_Shoe,twmtrn,Life hacks for keeping teeth white and drinking black coffee?,Coffee literally can’t stain your teeth in one day. It takes quite a bit of time.

i3geluf,2022-04-04 22:29:26,amdufrales,twmtrn,Life hacks for keeping teeth white and drinking black coffee?,I’ve done fairly well with Sensodyne whitening toothpaste which is pretty expensive but when you’re getting 4-6 months of use out of a $7-10 purchase… not so bad. I just appreciate a toothpaste that actually keeps my teeth fairly bright and shiny + none of the sensitivity issues I used to get with Crest or Colgate whitening pastes. I also drink quite a bit of Cabernet with dinner (and sometimes after lunch) probably 3 nights a week and the toothpaste seems to hold off most staining in any case!  Agreed with other commenters here about swishing or just drinking water after coffee though. I try to avoid coffee breath as a rule so it’s kind of a given for me,-,/r/Coffee/comments/twmtrn/life_hacks_for_keeping_teeth_white_and_drinking/i3geluf/'

Also if you insist on coffee first waiting 30min to brush post-coffee so the saliva can finish neutralizing the acid as brushing weakened enamel is bad news.  https://sprudge.com/9-out-of-10-dentists-agree-you-should-brush-your-teeth-before-drinking-coffee-174978.html  https://dentistexam.com/best-time-to-brush-your-teeth-after-drinking-coffee/,-,/r/Coffee/comments/twmtrn/life_hacks_for_keeping_teeth_white_and_drinking/i3gvbs9/'

i3g63up,2022-04-04 21:04:20,sprobeforebros,twk9mc,New to cold brew want to go all in and do a Nitrogen system inside my kegerator,so first you should make some cold brew and see if you like it. Absolutely no sense in buying a dedicated cold brew coffee brewer nitrogen tank and regulator if you dont actually like it.    Good news is this is incredibly simple. Buy a 12 oz / 340g bag of coffee ground extra coarse add it to 2L water let it sit in the fridge overnight strain out the grounds and youve got yourself some cold brew concentrate.  Cut it 1 part concentrate to 1 part water for a black coffee drink  or 1 part concentrate to 1 part milk for a cold brew au lait. Keeps for 2 weeks in the fridge  If you like it heres what you need:  [Toddy commercial cold brew system](https://www.espressoparts.com/products/toddy-commercial-model-cold-brew-system?variant=37555921191099) (incl. [nylon strainer](https://www.espressoparts.com/products/commercial-toddy-maker-strainer) and [paper filters](https://www.espressoparts.com/products/commercial-toddy-maker-filters))  [5 gallon cornelius keg](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/amcyl-5-gallon-keg-dual-rubber-handle)  Nitrogen tank (100% nitrogen not beer gas used to propel nitrogenated beers) (youll need to find this locally as most shipping companies wont ship big tanks of compressed gas. Look for beverage supply shops and welding supply shops)   [Nitrogen regulator](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/nitrogen-regulator)   [Nitrogen infuser](https://www.enhancedbeveragesolutions.com/products/nitro-infuser-single/2258048000001770065) (optional)  [Stout faucet](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/stout-faucet-stainless-steel-lever)  [Tubing](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/1-4-id-beverage-tubing) and [lock valves](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/ball-disc-1-4-barb-liq) to attach beverage and gas lines to kegs  [Coffee machine cleaner](https://www.espressoparts.com/products/espressoparts-espresso-machine-cleaner-by-puro-caff?variant=37553492656315)  [Sanitizing solution](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/star-san)  &#x200B  &#x200B  Get yourself 5 lb of extra coarse ground coffee. Put the brew platform in the toddy brewer. Put the nylon strainer in the toddy brewer with its elastic strap wrapped around the top of the bucket. Put the paper filter in the nylon strainer with the open end facing up. Add the coffee.  Add 7 quarts water. Tie off paper filter with string. Add 7 more quarts water. Put the lid on the brewer and put it in the fridge overnight.   The next day take the toddy brewer out of the fridge and put it on a work table. Sanitize the interior of your keg using the instructions on your sanitizing solution bottle. Once sanitized open the lid of the keg and place it under the faucet of the toddy brewer. Dispense the cold brew concentrate into your keg.  Add 2.5 gallons cold water to the keg. Seal the keg. Hook your regulator on your nitrogen regulator.    If youve got a nitrogen infuser split the gas line to go into the gas input of the infuser and the gas input of the keg. Hook up the beverage output to the keg and the other line to the beverage input on the infuser. Hook up the beverage output on the infuser to the faucet line on the kegerator.  Attach the stout faucet to the tap tower of the kegerator. Set the pressure on the nitrogen regulator to about 20 psi. Dispense some cold brew and tweak the needle valve on the nitrogen infuser until youve got a proper creamy head on the beverage without being 100% foam.   If you dont have a nitrogen infuser hook the gas line from the nitrogen tank up to the output line of the keg. Turn on the gas and crank the pressure up to 60 PSI. Remove the gas line and pull the depressurization ring on the keg until the kegs depressurized. Repeat these steps two more times. Once youve filled and depressurized the keg twice hook the gas line up to the output line of the keg and crank it to 60 PSI but this time dont depressurize the keg.  Unhook the gas from the output line of the keg and hook it up to the input line. Hook up the output line on the keg to a faucet line on the kegerator. Hook up the stout faucet to the tap tower of the kegerator. Set the pressure on the nitrogen regulator to 20 psi. Youll notice the first few drinks you dispense wont have much of a head on them but itll get bigger and better as the keg gets used.   Once the keg blows unhook the input and output lines of the keg pull the depressurization ring on the keg and open the lid when you can. Empty any residual coffee from the keg and give it a rinse. Fill the keg with hot water and 110g coffee machine cleaner. Let it sit until the water is at room temp. Hook the keg back up to the gas and beverage lines. Run a couple liters of the coffee cleaner water through the faucet.  Unhook the gas and beverage lines and depressurize the keg once more.

i3fxoc2,2022-04-04 19:54:00,cat_soup_,twk9mc,New to cold brew want to go all in and do a Nitrogen system inside my kegerator,Coming from the beer world but even nitro taps for beer arent 100% nitrogen. Its a co2 nitrogen blend. You need a nitrogen regulator and a nitro tank. They can withstand higher pressure. You also need a specific nitro tap faucet.  Another thought I had was that you could brew in one keg and then cold crash and transfer to serving keg using a floating dip tube so you dont get grounds in your finished product.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/twk9mc/new_to_cold_brew_want_to_go_all_in_and_do_a/i3fxoc2/'
i3g1rjd,2022-04-04 20:26:56,BaristaTech007,twk9mc,New to cold brew want to go all in and do a Nitrogen system inside my kegerator,You have a ton of options here. For one look at Kegoutlet.com they’ll have everything you’ll need. To start you could choose a special lid for your corny keg that has a carb stone attached in the middle of it. This will make the nitrogen bubbles smaller allowing the cold brew to absorb it better. Remember cold brew and No2 aren’t friends you need to force them to be. If you wanted to go with a higher end infuser that’s just works (we use it on our bar) and not the carb stone I would look at the Nitrogen Infuser Pro by Enhanced Beverage Solutions. It’s a really nice setup and easy to install. Their LE version would probably work good for you as well since you’re just using it at home. I would add some sort of small filter in the line from your keg to the infuser with that route. Either way you’ll need a stout tap.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/twk9mc/new_to_cold_brew_want_to_go_all_in_and_do_a/i3g1rjd/'

Not quite the strength or exact taste of a nitro cold brew but it’ll get you close. And you have the plus of being able to make many other drinks all with a different mouthfeel. Probably a bit more expensive but I launched myself down the rabbit hole about six months ago and haven’t looked back.  Edit - steam espresso in a cup with ice. Gives you a kind of microfoamy iced americano. Looks like a Guinness as the bubbles go away.,i3fvytq,/r/Coffee/comments/twk9mc/new_to_cold_brew_want_to_go_all_in_and_do_a/i3fxpy9/'

I wouldn’t recommend more than 35g of coffee per person per day for caffeine reasons. That’s about 5 shots of Italian espresso or 14oz of cold brew. Now let’s consider the 2 week expiration.  This makes an ideal batch size of 1.5 gallons per person. If there are at least 3 dedicated heavy coffee drinkers you might get away with a batch size of 5 gallons. Otherwise go for a 1.75gal or 2.5 gallon keg. It will be much easier to work with and you can fit it in a mini fridge.,i3fybbi,/r/Coffee/comments/twk9mc/new_to_cold_brew_want_to_go_all_in_and_do_a/i3h89ke/'

Both of the Gesha’s are washed processed coffees with one coming from the Planadas region of Colombia and the other from the Volcán region of Panama.  The [Colombia](https://www.cookiescaffe.com/buy-online/p/colombia-finca-la-miranda) is produced by Finca La Miranda and reveals notes of salted caramel pear and jasmine. The coffee is quite delicate with a great amount of clarity that pairs nicely with the smoothness and sweetness of the caramel note. This is available as either a light (city) roast or a medium-light (city+) roast for $20 (3.5 oz) or $50 (12 oz).  The [Panama](https://www.cookiescaffe.com/buy-online/p/panama-finca-santa-teresa) is grown and processed by Finca Santa Teresa and has a dominant taste of mandarin orange that is complemented by more subtle flavors of pear and vanilla. This coffee is also very delicate but it has a bit more of an acidic note to it. The acidity is not at all overwhelming however and acts more as a feature to the overall flavor profile than a main characteristic of the coffee. This is also available as a light (city) roast or medium-light (city+) roast but this is a bit more expensive at $25 (3.5 oz) or $60 (12 oz).  My new light roast spring blend is also now available and it is called [Cookie’s Hippity Hoppity Blend](https://www.cookiescaffe.com/buy-online/p/cookies-hippity-hoppity-blend). It consists of two Colombian coffees and one from Ethiopia that create a sweet and fruity blend with main notes of berries caramel and peaches. The blend will be available until it sells out or June/July for $20 (12 oz) or $50 (2 lb).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tw60gq/mod_the_official_deal_thread/i3dwiwz/'

Both of these are roasted to our Nordic light profile and are really tasting great right now. Hamasho is all peaches and flowers and Eden is bright blood orange and something like tomato too.

No ETA yet on the five outrageous Colombians that we have contracted.

The SGP is geared towards espresso and is a good starting point for espresso. It can grind for filter as well but dont expect a particular clean cup there. The Baratza Encore will probably do better there.  I guess you cant really do much wrong choosing either of those two. I decided to go for the SGP because I got a nice deal and it looks a lot better in my opinion.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tvyi0a/baratza_encore_vs_breville_smart_grinder/i3cf3qv/'
i3cmyb7,2022-04-04 06:38:06,DJRFG,tvyi0a,Baratza encore vs breville smart grinder.,The Encore is not designed for espresso. It can grind fine enough but the issue is the steps in the espresso fine region are too large so you cant perfectly dial it in.   If you will primarily be using the grinder for espresso the SGP is definitely a more suitable grinder. However if you will be using it for filter the Encore is potentially superior and has the option of the M2 burr upgrade which will improve it even further.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tvyi0a/baratza_encore_vs_breville_smart_grinder/i3cmyb7/'

Its annoying me to the point that I am considering replacing the machine which is otherwise perfectly fine with a different model/brand.

i3emnhy,2022-04-04 14:26:58,LEJ5512,tvy9m4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Ill suggest that pretty much anything can make decent iced coffee when you take into account the amount of ice that youre using.  By that I mean lets say you want to make a cup of iced coffee and to keep the math simple its a 250ml mug.  Coming from the common recommendation of 60g coffee per 1000ml of water youd use 15g of coffee grounds.  Thats even if you brew less than 250ml of hot coffee because the mug itself already has some ice cubes which take up 100ml themselves.  Or lets say it like this: Your goal is two 500ml travel mugs of iced coffee and your brewer has a 1000ml pot.  You load up the travel mugs with ice cubes and they turn out to be holding 300mls worth of ice in each.  So that means you have 200ml of space for liquid coffee.  You only need to brew 400ml total from the machine.  BUT you still want to use 60g of grounds because your total output is two 500ml mugs.  Making the hot coffee with such a high grounds:water ratio means it wont be so diluted once you pour it onto the ice.  I got a little wordy (okay a lot!) but does that make sense?  James Hoffman here shows a way to make iced coffee from a pourover and starting at 1:40 he explains the ratios: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PApBycDrPo0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PApBycDrPo0),i3e1v95,/r/Coffee/comments/tvy9m4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3emnhy/'

What the Niche does is accents the body and rounder chocolate notes so theres less emphasis on fruit notes. If you were to do the second option and get a good hand grinder for pour over and then a Mignon or similar grinder for espresso then I think youd end up with a slightly better option if you want fruitier notes in your pour overs.

If you hit tare while something is in the middle and then you move it to a corner the number is going to change because forces are different/leveraged there when it is not directly above the element.

Is this a common thing or should I get a new one?,Im not an expert at brewing nor a scientist - I recently bought a decent hand grinder as an upgrade to a blade grinder and a V60 that Ive been having a lot of fun with - but have you considered evaporation (not boiling)? Hot liquids tend to evaporate more readily than cold liquids and this is especially true of water. Using near-boiling temperatures you may have noticed some steam coming up from your slurry and maybe even from your finished brew. You could be losing mass due to that.  I have a scale that weighs pretty accurately in 1g increments 2g to start measuring. During the draw down I usually lose around 2-3g of mass which Ive been attributing to evaporation loss. I use my water after letting it cool for around 2 minutes (reading between 195-200F on a thermometer) assuming all other variables are the same if you were to use your water sooner it will be hotter and more ready to evaporate than my water.  Also remember that any lingering movement of the slurry (and brew in the cup!) can affect scale readings until it settles down as there may be both positive and negative pressures applied to the scale.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tvw37q/my_coffee_scales_dont_keep_track_of_weight_well/i421dsm/'

Heres a small experiment you can try.  Use a trivet or some other thermally insulated item between the scale and your cup. I bought some cheap cork ones from the dollar store.  Sometimes the heat from the item being weighed will cause the scale to think an item is heavier or lighter.

You dont need to spend much to get proper scales just as you wouldnt have to spend much on most of the equipment that was used to fly to the moon nowadays or at least much much less than back in the day.,i3bv3r2,/r/Coffee/comments/tvw37q/my_coffee_scales_dont_keep_track_of_weight_well/i3d2mny/'

Is this a common thing or should I get a new one?,Its a fair point but you absolutely can get decent scales for under $15. I have a Chinese knockoff of an older model Hario scale. Cost me something like $10. Had it for about 2 years and its absolutely fine. Times accurately weighs coffee accurately.   I did bring it to my bakery and check it against my commercial baking scales when I got it because Im pedantic like that and suspicious of Chinese knockoffs. Its completely accurate weighs up to 3kg and down to 0.1g.   On the other hand at that price point theres also gonna be a lot of crap and I totally did get lucky with this one.,i3bv3r2,/r/Coffee/comments/tvw37q/my_coffee_scales_dont_keep_track_of_weight_well/i3vhv1q/'

i3bfhf1,2022-04-03 22:11:02,UniqueLoginID,tvtats,Good Commercial Coffee Grinder for 800-1000$?,Youre in Mazzer territory and kinda dictated to by what the majority of cafes have bought and are selling.  * Small-medium = how many kg/s day/week? * Specialty cafe or nice coffee but more accessible?  Ideally <5yo used Robur and/or Major. A Robur will be easier to dial in and keep dialed.  A Kony is also valid for smaller volume as a starting point. A mini is fine for decaf (friends cafe ran one for 5 years) A super jolly could be an option for SOs.  Many roasters will do deals with equipment to lock you in. Keep this in mind as an option.  &#x200B  Personally assuming not huge volume Id be looking at:  * Used Robur or Kony depending on local pricing. Strong preference to the Robur. * Used SJ for decaf - locally the SJ is so much cheaper than a mini that there is little point getting a mini for decaf. * Used SJ(or Major) for SOs depending on marketplace prices. SJ cheaper.    * A Major would be ideal for SOs but is out of budget once factoring that primary conical grinder.  Be mindful of age cost of OEM burrs when burrs were changed bearing costs etc. the 64mm flats the bearings are <$20 and can be DIY.  Have in your budget a plan to move your primary grinder to a new leased or loaned via roaster grinder in your first 12-24 months. Even if you dont exercise this option.  If the primary grinder goes down you need a quick plan without having to think under stress. Having SJs on hand that can step up is one continuity plan.  &#x200B  &#x200B  Where my thoughts come from: multiple Mazzer owner (new and used) friend previously owned/ran cafe observed trends of cafes research sizes and grind times of commercial grinders for home.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tvtats/good_commercial_coffee_grinder_for_8001000/i3bfhf1/'

i3a2ig9,2022-04-03 15:30:44,squaredbear,tvl9v8,Hario Switch capacity,Ignore the suggested recipe. My go to recipe is a modification of Lance Hedricks 121 method. I usually do 20g to 340ml and have done as much as 30g to 500ml.     With the switch closed pour a 3x bloom swirling or stirring to make sure everything is wet. At 1:55 or so open the switch and at 2m pour hard just behind center up to about 10-12x or almost the top spiraling a bit to get everything moving and then slowly pour the remaining volume in slow spirals. I usually do a bit of a stir after I finish the pour and if I remember a swirl when it gets down to halfway.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tvl9v8/hario_switch_capacity/i3a2ig9/'

If you do it right (which is not difficult) it doesn’t matter what you brew it in it should come out essentially the same every time.

i39yiav,2022-04-03 15:01:14,TheElegiast,tvjhmk,anyone have one of these and is it any good?,So its about 16-18 grams of water per gram of coffee so 500 grams of water to 30 grams of coffee works well. Medium/coarse grind too. Coffee goes into the press first pour your water on top and wait for four minutes. At that point give it a gently stir use a spoon or two to remove the foam off the top (optional imo) and then wait another five minutes. At that point push the plunger down to the water line and no further then pour. The plunger doesnt need to be pushed down all that does is potentially push the sludge/silt past the filter.,i39vjr4,/r/Coffee/comments/tvjhmk/anyone_have_one_of_these_and_is_it_any_good/i39yiav/'

i39euzy,2022-04-03 12:42:06,Glitter_Crime_Daddy,tvhe87,White chocolate mocha,From a cafe its white chocolate sauce espresso and steamed milk typically. White chocolate sauce can be store bought or homemade. Real espresso is an EXPENSIVE hobby to fall into (Im not lying. Im talking like at least a thousand dollars and thats considered budget around here) so you might be way better off trying strongly brewed coffee (maybe in a moka pot or aeropress) or even instant. Steamed milk is usually made with the wand attachment of an espresso machine (again thousands of dollars...) but you can roughly approximate it by frothing hot milk instead: you can use in order of least expensive to most: a handheld battery powered whisk a French press or a dedicated milk frothing appliance.  It short: You are unlikely to exactly replicate it at home without spending an eyewatering sum of money but you can get kind of close with under $50 of equipment and some trial and error. You might be better off just occasionally buying one from the cafe though.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tvhe87/white_chocolate_mocha/i39euzy/'

Very low fines and high clarity. You can get the vario+ and add the steel burrs if you like the W+ comes with them preinstalled.

i38gqka,2022-04-03 08:47:45,VoteLobster,tvc4kd,is it just me or has peets major dickasons blend gotten bland?,Ignore the “fresh by” date. Coffee will taste blander the longer it’s been since its roast date. Were the last bags you got older by this measure? I like Peet’s as a grocery brand because they print their roast dates.   It’s also entirely possible that they changed a recipe and didn’t tell anyone (although big companies like Peet’s have a good ability to make things taste consistent from year to year mainly from roasting dark).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tvc4kd/is_it_just_me_or_has_peets_major_dickasons_blend/i38gqka/'

i38jk6a,2022-04-03 09:07:29,SaraVHella,tvc25b,Is this universally true? Or coffee specific?,The label is confusing but this is generally universally true. You’re dealing with two issues here: extraction and strength.   Extraction has to do with the balance of flavor compounds that were pulled from the brew. Underextracted coffee generally tastes sharp and sour overextracted tastes bitter and drying. The easiest way to adjust for extraction is grind size. If your coffee tastes sour you need more extraction so grind finer. If it tastes bitter you need less extraction so grind more course.   Strength is the overall amount of dissolved solids in your coffee. If your coffee tastes overpowering or muddy it’s strong if it’s thin and watery it’s weak. The easiest way to adjust for strength is dose aka your coffee-to-water ratio. If your coffee tastes too strong use less coffee for the same amount of water. If it tastes weak use more.   Easy-peasy!

Some people thought it was ok - I think one person said better than nothing and a couple noted it was good for the price but a lot more people found it frustrating to work with. It retains grounds pretty badly and can be difficult to dial in because the steps are too large apparently.

i39hjl4,2022-04-03 13:00:28,releasethattrack,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Yes  In my experience French press brings out more acidity than eg pour over or aeropress. Thats why darker roasts which tend to have lower acidity tend to excel in French press.

i38tul0,2022-04-03 10:18:27,coral225,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Acidity can be a positive note usually (and as someone else mentioned the metal filter will not reduce acidity like some paper filter methods) but sour tends to reflect a defect in either processing roasting or brew extraction. If the coffee is a super light roast and persists with different brew methods it might be the roaster under-developing the coffee. If it happened once and never again it might be one defective bean. If it happens with only French press and not your drip it is probably extraction error on your end.      There are some coffees where they have a good slightly sour note. What is your coffee?

i387u5c,2022-04-03 07:42:37,Justreadingplus,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,It might have to do with the metal filter of the french press without going into much detail a metal filter doesnt filter most (if not all) of the coffee oils it leads to a more flavorfull and less clear cup of coffee.

i39bp3r,2022-04-03 12:20:34,macktheknife80,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,While its true that it always depends on your beans but the difference in how much acidity you get boils down to extraction rate. The shorter extraction the lesser acidity you get. French press has the highest extraction rate of all because the beans are seeped in the hot water and stays in the press and extracting further. Aeropress solved this problem by pressing the coffee away from the grinds. Single cup drip coffee is pretty fast and usually results in a good balanced cup of coffee and is my personal favorite alongside an americano brewed on an espresso machine.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i39bp3r/'

i39fh0z,2022-04-03 12:46:16,Zealousideal_Bet2320,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Could be the roastness level sometimes beans can be over-roasted than stated on the bag. I’ve came across dark roasts or medium dark roasts when labeled as medium as I opened the bag and turned out bitter no matter how careful or precise I brew it.

i3bhyly,2022-04-03 22:38:43,anthonyngha,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Its so difficult to answer this there are way too many factors that influence acidity.  Lets just say French press is an immersive brewing method where the water and the coffee grounds simmer together for a while so you should expect more body and acidity in some cases. The french press filtering gives you more texture as well but you can regulate that with grind size.  Although you cant generalize I usually prefer Colombian and Tanzanian coffee in a french press over Ethiopian Brazilian and centeal American. Many coffee lovers would pair french press with asian origins such as Indonesian (Sumatra).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3bhyly/'

i38h6vn,2022-04-03 08:50:54,uniquedifferences,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,If you believe your coffee is under extracted (thin tasting over powering sourness salty flavors) then let it brew longer.   Try 14 minutes (total) as an experiment. I believe immersion extraction is pretty forgiving on brew times so you hopefully notice a difference. Do 7 minutes initial brew stir scoop out foam and floating bits and wait 7 minutes.  If that works try reducing to 6 and 6 to see if theres a difference.  Grind size could be the next thing to tweak going from coarse/medium coarse to closer to medium. The grind should look like small breadcrumbs.  Some sour highlights should be expected for most coffee. Theres nothing wrong with a bit of berry/citrus sparkle to your brew. Some of us love those rich coffee flavors with highlights like those.  Others hate any acid flavors and thats okay too. Drink whatever makes you feel happy!   I find experimenting like this is fun.

i38sx4m,2022-04-03 10:12:11,IKeepLosingThese,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,OP this comment right here is a good guide on what to do. If you find bumping up the brew time makes it better for you then you can do that. The other thing might be that you dont like the roast of the coffee. Lighter roasts are more acidic and darker roasts end up removing that. Another test to determine if you might have bitter sour confusion would be to add a little salt to the cup of coffee and see if it goes away. If it does it is bitter not sour and you might be over extracting by a bit.,i38h6vn,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i38sx4m/'

i3f5qzt,2022-04-04 16:33:30,VibrantCoffee,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,No. Paper filters mostly just removed undissolved solids and oils. Neither of which are particularly acidic. At a given extraction lets say 20% a FP is less acidic because it generally requires a longer brew time to get there so you get more of the slow-extracting compounds that tend to be more of the sugar-browning/sweet/savory/floral/bitter/etc compounds rather than the fast-extracting compounds many of which are acids. You still get all the acids of course but you just get more other stuff to change the overall flavor balance towards being less acidic.,i3et9iz,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3f5qzt/'
i3hcgn9,2022-04-05 05:25:41,VibrantCoffee,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,I know that.  If your FP tastes more acidic than your pourover you arent grinding fine enough for FP.

i3b2g0t,2022-04-03 20:08:31,wawasan2020BC,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Double your coffee weight and keep the same amount of water. Thats a 3:50 ratio and is a good starting point for pour overs and french press. A too concentrated pour over can be saved by adding some milk and sugar but theres no saving watery coffee.,i39t3x5,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3b2g0t/'

i3f66dz,2022-04-04 16:36:21,Ddawn_123,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Ok I’ll just have to try a finer grind then. And I’ll go for a coffee bean that doesn’t have citrus  in the flavor descriptors,i3f5qzt,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3f66dz/'
i39hwk6,2022-04-03 13:02:58,macktheknife80,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Yup. It is better imho. I would start with some generic brand at first just to try to see how you like it before investing in something costly.,i39hb3q,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i39hwk6/'
i3f7act,2022-04-04 16:43:55,VibrantCoffee,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Honestly even a coffee that has citrus as a tasting note wont normally be overly acidic if you are extracting enough from it. Depends on how sensitive you are to acidity (everyone is different). But yeah just keep grinding finer every time you make a FP until it starts tasting worse then back off a little. Make sure you pour very aggressively and/or stir a little to make sure that all the grounds are getting wet (no dry clumps).,i3f66dz,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3f7act/'
i3fakwb,2022-04-04 17:06:26,Ddawn_123,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Ok thanks. Do you typically stir early on ? I’ve been following the James hoffman method and stir after 4 minutes but I use a gooseneck kettle to make sure I saturate the grounds,i3f7act,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3fakwb/'
i3femwc,2022-04-04 17:33:46,VibrantCoffee,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,I personally dont stir at all if its a relatively small size brew. I just pour like a madman. A gooseneck is actually worse than a normal kettle with a wide mouth for this because the gooseneck really limits your flow rate. For a larger brew Id stir after a minute or two. The timing of the stir is not really crucial. Stirring is a different thing than pushing down any floating grounds and skimming the crust off the top. Stir really means get a spoon or whatever all the way down into the grounds and move them around.,i3fakwb,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3femwc/'
i3nvvyg,2022-04-06 12:01:45,Ddawn_123,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,I adjusted my grind size finer and made sure to push the grinds down below the foam during the first minute brewing. this definitely helped but I eventually hit a wall where grinding finer made things taste hollow. But it still had more acidity than a good cup of drip coffee. Maybe I could use a tea bag to make sure all of the grounds stay submerged ?,i3femwc,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3nvvyg/'
i3oieks,2022-04-06 14:20:43,VibrantCoffee,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,What kind of brew ratio are you using in the FP versus the drip coffee? Water temperature? There is just no way that you should be getting more acidity in a FP. Is it possible that you are just getting way less harsh astringency in your FP than you do in your drip coffee which is making you think it is more acidic? Does it taste sweeter than the drip coffee?,i3nvvyg,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3oieks/'
i3oj8lc,2022-04-06 14:26:06,Ddawn_123,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,For FP I use 30g coffee to 500 ml water. I’ve been using water from a tea kettle that just stopped boiling. I can’t really compare those to drip because I don’t make that at home I just get it from a good coffee shop. I wouldn’t say the coffee from the French press is that sweet but a longer brew time and finer grind did help. Maybe I should try another bean,i3oieks,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3oj8lc/'
i3ooljb,2022-04-06 15:01:42,VibrantCoffee,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Okay this is starting to make more sense. The coffee shop has a different grinder different water and different beans all of which have enormous effects on how much acidity you are tasting. So it isnt an apples to apples comparison of FP versus drip here.,i3oj8lc,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i3ooljb/'
i42vvdv,2022-04-09 13:43:18,Ddawn_123,tv9uzd,Acidity with French press,Ok I will have to adjust for other variables. Currently I’m using a kinu phoenix grinder do you think a commandante c40 would produce a better FP cup?,i3ooljb,/r/Coffee/comments/tv9uzd/acidity_with_french_press/i42vvdv/'

i3806h7,2022-04-03 06:41:00,bandrya,tv5vst,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,TLDR - What’s the best recipe to make 400-450ml coffee using a Hario Switch 02?  I am an Aeropress + Timemore C2 max user and have been enjoying great tasting coffee using James Hoffman’s Aeropress 2 cups recipe. It has allowed me to truly enjoy light roasts. I am now able to actually taste the sweet Blueberry Mango and other fruit flavors in light roast coffee. Before that my light roast cups tasted like highly acidic Orange juice 🤮  I recently received a Hario Switch 02 and several 02 filter papers as a gift. I followed James’ Switch recipe and made a great cup of coffee. However I want to be able to make two cups of coffee every morning and hopefully not have to immediately buy the V60 03 glass and filters right away.  I tried to modify James’ recipe for 2 cups. 25g relatively fine ground coffee bloom with 50g water release. Then add 175g water hold 2min and release. Then add 200g water hold 2min and release. So 425g water for 25g coffee.  The result was not good 😕 Coffee tasted sour when hot. It tasted more balanced when it reached room temperature. I would love for it to taste balanced while hot.  As sourness indicates under-extraction I tried going finer (11clicks on Timemore C2) and also boiling water before each pour. But still the taste didn’t improve.

i3b0c0i,2022-04-03 19:51:31,cdogrob,tv5vst,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Dumb question alert [in this video](https://youtu.be/D-bV4j-Z-sU) he manually “kills” the shot once he hits a 2:1 and because it’s between 30-35 seconds they consider it “good” but the machine(barista pro) isn’t necessarily done… for instance when I’m setting up my machine at home I’m killing my pull when I hit a 2:1(32 seconds) but when if I didn’t press the button the machine would pull for another 5 seconds.. which is 38-40 seconds.   Sooo… my question is does the machine remember the custom setting once It pull automatically? Doesn’t seem like it.  Do I just always pull shots using the custom feature? Or should I let it pull all the way through when I’m setting up and not use the custom set up feature?   Any information would be great.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3b0c0i/'

Ive been using the Gaggia Brera for the past 3 years and while it makes okay coffee Id really like to upgrade to a separate espresso machine and grinder for true rich espresso.  Im in the UK and my budget is around £1500 for the set. After some initial research Im thinking the Rancilio Silvia Pro X and Eureka Mignon Silenzio would be a good pairing the low noise level of the Silenzio is appealing. I make 4-6 shots per day. Id be appreciative of your thoughts and if you have any other recommendations.  Thanks in advance!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3c0k38/'

i3db6vr,2022-04-04 09:25:17,redsunstar,tv5vst,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,The steel burrs produce less fines. So they need to be more perfectly parallel to grind fine enough for espresso whereas the ceramic burrs arent as demanding regarding parallelism.   You can find a lot of resources online for aligning Vario grinders with steel burrs. Its dubbed the Alicorn procedure or the super-alignment procedure. Its a bit involved (2 hours at least many more possibly) but once aligned the Vario with steel burrs can produce very close to of the best espresso grinds for light roast and medium roast coffee. At any price point.   But if youre trying to pull a dark roast with traditional parameters youre going to have a bad time. And Baratza isnt confident enough that the steel burrs would be well aligned enough out of the factory.,i39hgbx,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3db6vr/'

The Ode could work for you if youre willing to adjust your recipe and/or drink darker roasts.   Lighter roasts probably not so much. Fwiw I am currently using 14 clicks on my Comandante with the standard Hoffmann Aeropress recipe and the Ode v1s finest setting was equivalent to 20-21 clicks. The 1.1 burrs are supposed to go 10% finer which probably wont cut it (but I havent tried it).

White chocolate sauce can be store bought or homemade. Real espresso is an EXPENSIVE hobby to fall into (Im not lying. Im talking like at least a thousand dollars and thats considered budget around here) so you might be way better off trying strongly brewed coffee (maybe in a moka pot or aeropress) or even instant. Steamed milk is usually made with the wand attachment of an espresso machine (again thousands of dollars...) but you can roughly approximate it by frothing hot milk instead: you can use in order of least expensive to most: a handheld battery powered whisk a French press or a dedicated milk frothing appliance.        It short: You are unlikely to exactly replicate it at home without spending an eyewatering sum of money but you can get kind of close with under $50 of equipment and some trial and error. You might be better off just occasionally buying one from the cafe though.,i39ey01,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i39fk58/'

i3bzngz,2022-04-04 02:38:42,mangoie,tv5vst,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,You can split your question in two parts: 1:Espresso recipe and 2:machine usage.     1. When you are making espresso its good to have a recipe in mind. You can start with amount of ground coffee in your filter (usually +-1g what the manufactures says) and then you decide how much grams of actual espresso you want in your cup. This grounds in/espresso out is usually noted as the ratio. So 17g ground coffee->34g espresso in cup=1:2 ratio.  Some people define the type of espresso depending on this ratio: ristretto as 1:1 normal espresso 1:2 and a lungo as 1:3+.  In general when increasing the ratio  you will lose a bit of the sourness/fruitiness and syrupy mouth feel and get in return a bit more flavours/complexity. But no matter the ratio initial aim is always 25-30s shot time. (This 25-30s rule is just a sort of general consensus for being in the general right ballpark of a good shot... but you can get a amazing shot far outside this timeframe)   2. The Breville machines use a water flow meter to measure how much water goes though your coffee puck. Usually Breville machines with buttons can be manually programmed (press a special button or go into the menu) for a certain amount of water so you brew your own intended ratio for your espresso! Cant I just set it up once for my 18g 1:2 espresso recipe??. Well you will see that the coffee puck actually absorbs an retains a bit of water during the shot usually I see about 1g of water retained by 1g of espresso grind. But because coffee is a product of nature have different densities and are roasted in different ways this amount can vary a lot. So its better to just measure your espresso during the shot with a scale and stop it at your intended ratio (and adjust your grind if necessary). The machines just outputs the programmed amount of water regardless of anything else. The guy from the video just stops the shot manually because the reached his recipe (intended ratio). Because it falls into the 25-30s timeframe he deems it a good shot.       In general this automatic volume control is handy if you dont want to spend a lot of time on your espresso or when you need to make a lot of coffees at a birthday party. It works really well but of you want to get the maximum out of your coffee you always have to measure it!,i3b0c0i,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3bzngz/'

i38t3be,2022-04-03 10:13:22,_Insider,tv5vst,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Youre right that the comparision is not ideal and dont take the absolute numbers too seriously my point is that especially if youre into lighter roasts you can be very far away from your ideal grind size. Most reports about the Ode refer to filter and Aeropress grind sizes are usually a fair bit finer than that. In terms of imperfect Comandante settings Im usually between 20 and 25 for V60 and 14-18 for Aeropress.   Youre right about hand grinders and I would give them a try. Of course an electric grinder is more convenient but nicer hand grinders are very fast. I dont really mind hand grinding since it takes less time than my kettle does. You also get the added benefit of lower retention for single dosing.,i38r7i0,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i38t3be/'
i3fefob,2022-04-04 17:32:20,Hour-Neighborhood311,tv5vst,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Thats what I do and I use the start/stop button to turn the grinder off once the beans are completely ground. Full disclosure Im using a Forte BG but it should work identically and has the same burrs and design.  I have to say theres a bit of variation in output when you single dose this way. Sometimes I get a little less out than I put in and sometimes I get a little more. The advantage of using the built in scale is that the grams out is always very close to what your setting is. Theres also a little bit of ground coffee from the previous grind mixed in with your current grind. This makes dialing in a new bean for espresso a bit wasteful. The amounts are small enough to not matter to me with filter coffee. I would expect the Vario + to be the same.,i3e9aiw,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i3fefob/'

i39h90j,2022-04-03 12:58:24,realplyx,tv5vst,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I disagree with the other commenter with the baseline of espresso being at least 1k dollars. If you want actual espresso you can buy a manual lever machine like a Flair signature. That would require you to have a separate milk frother which you can use a french press to substitute.  For cheap machines that have steam wands consider the Gaggia Classic or Breville/Sage Bambino. I think the steam wand on the Bambino is a little better while the coffee and modding potential is higher on the Gaggia.  And because you’re not always making coffee a nice hand grinder should be serviceable.,i39fnof,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i39h90j/'

I can definitely see why but at least for me comparing my very old Hario ceramic burr to my Comandante is a difference like night and day. And I think that you can find a lot of posts on this forum that will say the same. Of course its still not quite as comfortable as electric.   Definitely check out the 1zpresso Q2. It fits into an Aeropress and its basic (pentagonal) burr is decent for the price - it is a nice upgrade over the Rancilio. If you can find it get the heptagonal burr which is a clone of the Comandante burr. I believe that it is only available in China- I got mine via Aliexpress.,i38wpa5,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i38yy8o/'

i391qs6,2022-04-03 11:11:48,_Insider,tv5vst,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,The Kinu is a very nice grinder. However I am only familiar with the standard burr which is espresso-focused i.e. more fines (similar to your Rancilio). This profile is nice for darker roasts but many prefer more unimodal grind profiles (like the Comandantes) for lighter fruity filter coffees. In theory the Kinu pour over burr should give you exactly that but youd have to check other reviews. Assuming that the pour over burr does what it says the burr choice will depend on your preference (light vs dark) and where you see your coffee preference going (V60 or proper espresso).   Just to add some options to your list for filter-focused hand grinders the most popular choices are the Comandante and 1zpresso K pro/plus/max for espresso it would be the 1zpresso J-max or Kinu (standard burr).,i38zygi,/r/Coffee/comments/tv5vst/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i391qs6/'

And he really likes espresso so I can see that adding to this enthusiasm.   Ultimately it seems yourself and many others here recommend the Comandante and it’s standard burr (a unimodal burr) for both pour over and areopress.  Since many others here (and in competitions) use this grinder it will be easier to get advice related to grind.   So I’ll get the Comandante C40 MK4 Hand Grinder zero it and start with 14 clicks!

i37dt6t,2022-04-03 02:20:21,icebearsuga,tv58wh,Oatly Barista vs Sanitarium’s So Good Oat Barista.,I own a small coffee shop and since Oatly’s rather expensive for me I decided to explore other options and I come across So Good. The cheapest one from other Oat Milk brands I think.   I exclusively use Oatly for my Cold Brew since its subtle oat taste compliments the delicate cold brew and So Good for espresso based. It’s been a month since using So Good and so far I can say it’s amazing. Very oat-y but compliments espresso-based coffee well with its thick body. I have a feeling it’s better than most of Oatly’s known competitors—AND AGAIN CHEAPER.   I don’t have a steam-wand with what I use but judging by how well So Good’s froths with just a froth wand it might froth even better with steam than oatly.   And look at the nutritional facts So Good’s sugar per 100ml is less than Oatly’s! Though I’m not really knowledgeable with nutritional facts as much (maybe you guys can give your two-cents about their nutritional facts ☺️)   There’s also this thing I do to preserve milks’ shelf-life. When I know it’s gonna be a slow day I place my opened milks inside the freezer. And leave them in the fridge overnight to defrost them. Defrosted So Good still froths better than Oatly’s which is very surprising.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv58wh/oatly_barista_vs_sanitariums_so_good_oat_barista/i37dt6t/'

i37hf7r,2022-04-03 03:10:12,MarcTes,tv4fjo,Cold Brew Woes,I make cold brew a couple of times a week and this is how I do it. For beans I use some of the lighter roasts from Equator Coffee which roasts and sells amazing quality beans.  (They are also my go-to source for espresso beans.) They ship everywhere as soon as they’re roasted.  For cold brew there is no problem freezing the beans (I freeze them about four days off roast) which is how I store them until ready to use.  I have found that lighter roasts produce mellower less acidic cold brew.  I use the Oxo cold brew system (pretty inexpensive and foolproof - get the large one) which I have found works best of all of the many tools and systems I’ve tried.  It comes with clear simple instructions and has a built-in filter.  Using a Baratza Virtuoso + I grind the beans course at the 38 setting.  Grinding the beans fresh is essential to the success of cold brew.  Once I add purified spring water I let the beans steep at room temperature for 24 hours which produces a very smooth concentrate that I then refrigerate. Diluted at about 3 or 4 to 1 and mixed with almond milk over ice it makes fabulous iced coffee.  No sugar needed.  I hope this helps.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv4fjo/cold_brew_woes/i37hf7r/'
i37apog,2022-04-03 01:37:24,Nakashi7,tv4fjo,Cold Brew Woes,What about letting it brew immersed in any container (big glass jars for example) and then strain it through any paper filter dripper or even aeropress. You get full immersion and a clean cup with paper straining.  If paper waste is an issue metal aeropress filter or that french press seem to be the best options. If silt from metal filtering is an issue there is a middle ground between metal and paper and that is a cloth filter for drippers (less silt than metal and still no paper waste).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv4fjo/cold_brew_woes/i37apog/'

I use the provided felt filters as well as a lg paper filter just to make cleanup easier. Put in 1lb or medium ground coffee fill the water to the 1lb line and come back 24 hrs later. It yields a concentrate that I dilute 3 parts water to 1 part coffee. It makes enough concentrate for my partner and I to each fill a 32oz yeti with ice (~20 oz liquid) for 7-10 days or just me for 2 weeks.   Im sure this is blasphemy here but I dont change anything I do based on the coffee I put in the simplicity is why I like it.

They even sell cloth bags labeled specifically for cold brew. Coffeesock is one of them.   If you want something really cheap you can go to a fabric store and buy a yard or so of unbleached cotton muslin cloth.  Wash the cloth with hot water and unscented soap or baking soda before use. You can line the cloth on a colander or pasta strainer and wring out the cold brew. It should catch most of the coffee grounds.   You’ll want to regularly clean the nut milk bags or muslin cloth with unscented soap. Coffee oils left in the cloth will oxidize and impart a nasty rancid flavor to the final drink.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv4fjo/cold_brew_woes/i3fxvr9/'

i37ev7q,2022-04-03 02:34:53,Atomaholic,tv4eww,How much do you purge using the Niche Zero grinder?,The whole point of the Niche is Zero retention so you literally dont need to purge when changing grind size.  I have noticed that maximum of 0.2g remains in the chute occasionally after I grind but it can easily be cleared by gently lifting/rocking the unit forward and is probably more to do with the unit not being truly level on my countertop than any actual retention within the grind/burrs/hopper itself.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv4eww/how_much_do_you_purge_using_the_niche_zero_grinder/i37ev7q/'

i36ovkg,2022-04-02 21:16:19,oneblackened,tv09pd,[Question] Are Arabica beans significantly better than Robusta for cold brewing?,  Arabica is: sweeter more acidic has more oil and less caffeine (at max about 1.7% caffeine).   Robusta is: earthier more bitter has less oil and more caffeine.   I think even in cold brew youd notice a difference between pure Arabica and pure Robusta... just dont use expensive specialty coffee because cold brew totally mutes any sort of interesting origin characteristics.   Arabica/Robusta blends like traditional Italian coffees might actually work nicely in cold brew. Theyre generally medium to dark roasts primarily Arabica with some Robusta blended in for body and texture (Robusta produces more crema in espresso).  My understanding is that traditional Vietnamese coffee is dark roasted Robusta mixed with sweetened condensed milk to cut the bitterness.  As for light vs dark its all preference. For the coffee I drink I almost never go darker than a 3rd wave espresso roast which is firmly medium.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tv09pd/question_are_arabica_beans_significantly_better/i36ovkg/'

i36jn9c,2022-04-02 20:28:45,MarcTes,tuzmaw,Wanting to improve my cold brew. Suggestions on technique/coffee?,I suspect that the dryness you’re experiencing is produced by the tannins in dark roast coffee which is not preferable for cold brew.  I make cold brew a couple of times a week and this is how I do it. For beans I use some of the lighter roasts from Equator Coffee which roasts and sells amazing quality beans.  (They are also my go-to source for espresso beans.) They ship everywhere as soon as they’re roasted.  For cold brew there is no problem freezing the beans (I freeze them about four days off roast) which is how I store them until ready to use.    I use the Oxo cold brew system which I have found works best of all of the tools I’ve tried.  Using a Baratza Virtuoso + I grind the beans course at the 38 setting.  Grinding the beans fresh is essential to the success of cold brew.  Once I add purified spring water I let the beans steep at room temperature for 24 hours which produces a very smooth concentrate that I then refrigerate. Diluted at about 3 to 1 and mixed with almond milk over ice it makes fabulous iced coffee.  No sugar needed.  I hope this helps.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tuzmaw/wanting_to_improve_my_cold_brew_suggestions_on/i36jn9c/'

i37at1u,2022-04-03 01:38:41,MrJackChicMiMoon,tuk76g,Best way to heat water in hotel room no microwave.,Ill give you that its for partially to do with tea vs coffee but lots of people in the UK drink coffee instead of tea and tend to have instant (freeze-dried coffee grounds you add hot water to and stir). Our voltage is about twice as high so our kettles boil about twice as fast.   We do have regional variations in speed of boil though and thats down to the water. The midlands and south east have hard water where mineral content is much higher due to limestone in our bedrock amongst other things. Over time unless you use a Britta filter  the mineral is boiled out of the water and deposited on the kettle. This slows it down noticeably as well as leaving weird patches on the surface of your brew. Thankfully a caustic clean every so often gets rid of it.,i36elcx,/r/Coffee/comments/tuk76g/best_way_to_heat_water_in_hotel_room_no_microwave/i37at1u/'

You get a gross little pod plastic coffee maker in your room. Usually NO tea. Some places have a Keurig. Microwaves are sometimes an extra charge.   People are gross and I ever trust a room coffee maker. At best you hope it was never maintained/cleaned. People let their kids play with them or do stupid shit like cook instant soup in the carafe.

i36v3gb,2022-04-02 22:19:45,chainmailler2001,tuk76g,Best way to heat water in hotel room no microwave.,Just before Covid shut things down I stayed at a nice hotel where we were attending an event. The suite had a Keurig style coffee maker in the room that brewed a single cup at a time directly into a coffee cup. We used it for brewing a tea we were sampling out at the event by using a refillable Keurig cup. Came out scalding hot every time.  They had the event again this year in person which didnt happen last year. This time the room had a regular coffee pot with a 4 cup capacity. We werent doing the sampling this time so didnt need it but it certainly wouldve been easier to use than the Keurig!,i36hq04,/r/Coffee/comments/tuk76g/best_way_to_heat_water_in_hotel_room_no_microwave/i36v3gb/'

i37b173,2022-04-03 01:41:43,MrJackChicMiMoon,tuk76g,Best way to heat water in hotel room no microwave.,Our voltage is about 2x higher so if the current is the same or will boil the water around 2x faster so we use kettles for lots of water-heating tasks not just beverages (we drink a lot of instant coffee too).   Hot water for pasta rice potatoes stock jelly (read as jello) and veg would often be boiled in the kettle as it boils much quicker than a pan does. Hot water bottles when you are ill or have an injury are filled from the kettle as the kettle spout makes it ideal to pour into the hot water bottle. Most of this requires more water than would make sense to do in a microwave and a pan would take too long.,i36j7d4,/r/Coffee/comments/tuk76g/best_way_to_heat_water_in_hotel_room_no_microwave/i37b173/'
i386j0a,2022-04-03 07:32:41,_ShortGirlProblems_,tuk76g,Best way to heat water in hotel room no microwave.,I still think it’s a matter of drinking different beverages. Most Americans drink drip coffee not instant coffee or tea. So they wouldn’t have much use or need for an electric kettle. Many people here don’t even have a stovetop kettle. If they need hot water there is the microwave. The voltage difference would only amount to a couple minutes more to boil the kettle of water which isn’t significant enough to keep Americans from using them. Brewing a pot of coffee takes longer than boiling the water in the kettle would. It’s just a taste preference.,i37at1u,/r/Coffee/comments/tuk76g/best_way_to_heat_water_in_hotel_room_no_microwave/i386j0a/'

i33qta3,2022-04-02 06:03:33,LeutDan,tuiah3,Bonavita 8 Cup - Caution - Poor wiring results in melting plastic,Sorry for the crappy photo but I think you can see the issue. Had the coffee maker (Bonavita BV1901TS) for over a year with no issues went to make coffee this morning and it just smelled like burning plastic in the kitchen (initially thought it was just the Folgers I was brewing since my parents were over). Unplugged the coffee maker and found melted plastic on the bottom cover opened up the bottom and saw the wiring in the photo. Something must have shorted and melted through the wiring cap and base of the unit. I snipped off the damaged portion of the wires and re-attached everything with a decent cap seems to work ok now but Im suspicious since it seems like a build quality issue with poor wiring. Ill probably email them eventually but from what Ive heard on here Bonavita might not be a functioning company at this point.

I use the carafe to make two 12 oz cups (the five cup line on the water reservoir).        To be honest I couldnt tell you what tasted better. Once you have a good bean and work the grind drip coffee is pretty good in either brands coffee maker. But the OXO has one advantage: the OXO 8 cup makes a smashing single cup with the special insert and single cup setting (it adjusts the water flow).

Dark roast grinds take more volume but I think breville standard double basket can still take it in. Just use a dosing funnel to catch grind into portafilter skip the spinning distributior and use WDT for distribution with funnel on then tap and tamp.

i33nsvw,2022-04-02 05:33:13,indianajonesy7,tuhksb,Breville barista express grounds too high for porta filter,If you’re dosing 18g at a fine enough grind to be fluffy then yes this is normal. I bought one of the dosing funnels that locks on and activates the grinder ([here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094NDWLFH/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_RMJ958VAS8336EPD61JE?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)) and also use a WDT tool to declump with the collar on. I don’t personally think the razor tool is particularly accurate on the height for tamping. I do a spin with the distro tool (don’t worry about this tamping) and then tamp as hard as I can to finish (debating about springing for the normcore mostly for the guaranteed level).

i368wy8,2022-04-02 18:59:27,Bridgerton,tufdni,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,My mokapot brewing experience is still all over the place. Sometimes it flows easily other times it starts out thick and bubbly. But today was the first time my brew was too watery - it was almost like a regular pourover in color and I drank the whole thing (stopped as soon as I heard bubbling from inside) in one go with milk.  Are there any glaring factors that may have changed my brew today?   -	On a few occasions I’ve had to reopen and screw back the mokapot because the pressure seemed to be leaking out between the bottom and top. This time I re screwed the pot even before putting it on the stove and the brew flowed out easily after maybe 30 secs.  -	I used 17g espresso roasted beans that is 2 months from roast date. My basket was not level-full but almost full. But yesterday I also had an almost-full basket and the brew was initially syrupy thick. -	My flame was low enough to just touch the bottom.  -	I filled the bottom chamber with hot water below the valve.  Not really sure there’s an answer but I might as well ask. TIA!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tufdni/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i368wy8/'

Chemex is the one I use most rarely. I typically brew about 12oz at a time because my husband and I dont share the same beans so it only comes down from the top shelf if I am entertaining which we used to do weekly but now do far less now since Covid. (I do need to qualify that I personally only use the small French press for 8oz cups of tea. I dont use it for coffee. Husband prefers the small one for coffee if hes brewing for himself though.)   At various points Ive also owned a size 1 V60 a kalita wave and an aeropress but I gave them all away. The V60 was too small the kalita wave I had trouble finding filters for during covid so I replaced it with the bee house which uses standard #2 filters and the aeropress I disliked because it took too long to air dry and was annoying/difficult to towel dry.,i34100b,/r/Coffee/comments/tufdni/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i349vuf/'

i33kenw,2022-04-02 04:56:05,MikeTheBlueCow,tufdni,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Everything Ive seen in my Costco would be a dark roast and would have had enough time sitting to get a nice oily sheen. Though I am not familiar with that specific brand I would have to think it is simply oils based on 1) Ive never seen actual condensation in a bag of coffee 2) its common to see oils on coffee 3) [their website seems to show dark roasts](https://sfbaycoffee.com/collections/whole-bean-1).   In general this is common to have dark oily beans. I would say if you like the taste the oils do not matter/are not a problem. If you end up thinking it tastes harsh bitter ashy smokey etc. then you would want to avoid dark oily roasts for future purchases.,i33fpug,/r/Coffee/comments/tufdni/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i33kenw/'

i37lsit,2022-04-03 04:09:29,bostoncreampuff,tufdni,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Ultimately it came down to the speed of flow rate. They both makes good coffee and they both) have the common stall issues towards the end of the brew. Kalita is more forgiving because of the slow flow rate but because of the slow flow rate  it is sort of an one trick pony. I never had a really bad cup from the kalita but never an mind blowing cup either.  The torch is much faster and therefore more flexible in terms of techniques you can try!

i3apbb4,2022-04-03 18:24:43,rumuraisin,tufdni,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Nothing built for single dosing which is why those products exist in that category.

i340p6z,2022-04-02 07:29:20,DeBray3,tufdni,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yep. This is normal for dark roasts and that appears to be a very dark roast. I am a dark roast drinker myself. The beans I have are about as oily as that  The lipids do add a bit of thickness to the coffee as it is prepared. The fats also stay on the tongue leaving you with a longer lasting and richer after taste.  Its all up to personal preference.

i33uar8,2022-04-02 06:35:41,all_systems_failing,tueit0,Looking for an easy to adjust coffee grinder,There arent a lot of single dose options and they typically do better for one brew method or the other. That being said you might consider the Lagom Mini. The only others I can think of will either be substantially more expensive than the Niche (Lagom P64) or arguably not as good (Eureka Oro).  The other option and what a lot of people do is to have two grinders. This way you dont have to worry about retention or dialing the grind back in when switching between coffees or methods. Manual grinders do really well for filter and are easy to put away if youre concerned about clutter.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tueit0/looking_for_an_easy_to_adjust_coffee_grinder/i33uar8/'

i33gzng,2022-04-02 04:14:47,Spampyspamps,tuehen,Espresso newbie here: is the Sage/Breville built in grinder fit for grinding for espresso?,It is more then capable. Sage machines are just particular about the coffee they like.  It needs to be fresh quality coffee that’s a medium to medium dark roast. Anything else does not work well. Also you can recalibrate the burrs to make grind finer or more coarse depending on what you need.

i34jezx,2022-04-02 09:50:52,Spampyspamps,tuehen,Espresso newbie here: is the Sage/Breville built in grinder fit for grinding for espresso?,It’s technically a stepless grinder. It has numbers as “steps” but the internals are basically stepless. They’ve designed it specifically for dialing in espresso so if it’s on that line of too fast or slow just alter your tamp a bit and that should compensate.   Also if push comes to shove they come with pressurised baskets that will instantly fix the problem. Keep in mind it’s ESSENTIAL that you run some empty shots of hot water through the basket to preheat it.

An insulated metal one would retain temperature better but thats not an advantage in and of itself: it changes extraction and how hot the coffee will be when served but all that means to me is a change in recipe to obtain the same result.

i33wu0i,2022-04-02 06:57:32,DeBray3,tua1tv,Why aren’t metal French presses more popular vs. Glass? Is one better?,Glass has one major upside in my opinion. It looks pretty. Its nice to see the coffee brewing inside of the glass.  However I once had a glass French press shatter because I knocked it over. My arm was cooked from the boiling hot coffee and grounds. The bits of glass stuck into my skin was just the shit cherry on top of the disastrous milkshake.  Then I bought a metal press. Its insulated durable heavier more stable because its bottom heavy and wont leave shards of glass stuck into your skin if the worst comes to worst.   The only downside is that the black paint from the press is starting to flake off. If it gets bad enough Im just going to take all the paint off and shine up the metal. My set is a majority stainless steel anyway. The press and kettle being the only two black pieces in my set.   If it were up to me I would only recommend metal french presses.

Probably my favorite (if least messy!) incidents were when I managed to accidentally whack the things wrong on the sink while washing them out. On two different occasions. :-|   Then I finally had the sense to switch over to stainless maybe 10 years ago. That £15 one from Sainsburys would no doubt still be in regular use if we hadnt lost it in a move last year. I replaced it with a smaller stainless Bodum which has also been great so far.  The only real difference I ever noticed in use besides the durability? Youll likely want to preheat them before use because they do tend to absorb a lot more heat. With darker roast coffees before I had a temperature controlled kettle Id often just use preheat a little with hot tap water and then brew with boiled  The temperature balanced out pretty nicely.

i34spa6,2022-04-02 10:57:13,pokey1984,tua1tv,Why aren’t metal French presses more popular vs. Glass? Is one better?,>An insulated metal one would retain temperature better but thats not an advantage in and of itself: it changes extraction and how hot the coffee will be when served but all that means to me is a change in recipe to obtain the same result.  This is very much a factor in my limited experience.  Ive been brewing by feel more or less since I started using a press.  I bought the Mueller one mentioned in another thread as my first and took about a dozen pots to figure out how to brew with it.  (Yes Im weird.  I wanted to figure out how to make non-fussy coffee just look at the water know Ive got the right amount of grounds based on how they look in the pot etc.  Ive gotten pretty good.)  Then I won a free glass press just a little one-cup model.  I hadnt ever used it before but I took it when I went to visit my sister for a few weeks last month because I felt it would take up less of her kitchen.  Its nice but the glass one requires a completely different method.    For example my metal carafe needs the water to be at about 205 (bubbles just starting to break but not fully boiling).  Any hotter than 205 and the coffee comes out bitter and over-extracted with my brand.  But I found with the smaller glass carafe that I really need the water to be at a full rolling boil or else the coffee tastes sour and weak.  Now some of that may have to do with the size of the carafe.  My glass one is significantly smaller.  But it also does not retain heat at all.  By the time Ive steeped the coffee poured it and added my cream and sugar my coffee is already at a drinking temp.  With my metal carafe I have to let the cup sit for another six or eight minutes before I can drink it without hurting myself.    The person who introduced me to a french press in the first place actually used a plastic one designed for camping.  Id really like to find one like his because that really seemed to be the best of both worlds.  It was lighter in heft like the glass ones but really held the heat well like my metal one.  (And yes I know plastic and heat are supposedly a bad combination.  IDC.  My other bad habits are gonna kill me long before I get cancer from a plastic coffee carafe.),i332j00,/r/Coffee/comments/tua1tv/why_arent_metal_french_presses_more_popular_vs/i34spa6/'

Ive never broken one and Im not sure I see how people manage it but at least that didnt give me a reason to change.  I have the same thought but I always hand wash my french press. Then after running it in the dishwasher and then hand washing it after a use it was super slippery so that may be part of it.  >An insulated metal one would retain temperature better but thats not an advantage in and of itself: it changes extraction and how hot the coffee will be when served but all that means to me is a change in recipe to obtain the same result. You can definitely do delicious coffee in both a metal and a glass one.  Agree with this. I borrowed a stainless steel one to try out and it makes a huge difference to the taste/extraction.

I use a french press made out of a stainless steel for my daily morning cups. I dont notice any odd metallic taste. I also use the Alton Brown method and put a pinch of sea salt in my grounds. This reduces acidity which may also be a reason I dont taste any weird metallic flavor. The coffee doesnt erode the metal as much.   Its also the reason my teeth are unusually white.   I used to own a glass French press as well but that thing decided it had enough shattered and gave me a burn I will never forget.

Immersion brewers like the French Press extract 95% of solubles in the first 30 seconds when the water temp is equal in both glass and metal.

i32kxvt,2022-04-01 21:07:01,Laughingsheppard,tu9mdj,What to buy - coffee station equipment?,I recommend a pour over if you have the time rather than a coffee pot. Ideally a Chemex if you want to make more than one cup at a time.  Grinder I would say Bodum for the cheaper side Baratza Encore for the next step up OR the Fellow Ode for maximum coffee station points. Also an electric kettle is life changing. Again Fellow makes really great coffee equipment so if you can afford it go for Fellow Stagg.

Second part of the setup is please please buy a goddamn scale and use it if you arent already. Hell put a cheapo scale in before you get the grinder upgrade.      ---------------------------------- Nail the basics of technique and youll go far with ALL equipment.

i3187wd,2022-04-01 14:17:33,CornettoAlCioccolato,tu1bwr,Coffee machine tips for a buyer,- You’re almost certainly going to have some maintenance somewhere. The combination of electricity heat acidity water and possibly pressure (if you’re doing espresso) wears things. - The most BIFL solutions are those that avoid some of these problems and ones that you aren’t going to feel compelled to upgrade to the cool new toy. A chemex V60 pourover French press or Moka Pot for instance is going to last. I’ve never had a bulletproof electric kettle — those will ultimately wear (because of the aforementioned issues) - Ground coffee degrades quickly. It’s worth spending money on a grinder and an absolute necessity if you’re doing espresso. You don’t want it in the same device as the machine though for failure isolation.  The approach I’d probably take is a temperature-controlled electric kettle a nice grinder and any of an aeropress v60 French press or chemex. The kettle is basically a necessity for doing tea right and very useful for coffee no matter the other decisions. Likewise the grinder for coffee. Then the coffee apparatus is cheap/durable enough that you don’t really need to worry and you have more budget left over for later.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tu1bwr/coffee_machine_tips_for_a_buyer/i3187wd/'

i31cfwq,2022-04-01 14:48:57,Mirthgiver,tu1bwr,Coffee machine tips for a buyer,I only drink espresso so won’t be much help on other brewing methods. Traditional Espresso machines are very “Buy it for life friendly”. The actual machinery involved is very simple and as long as you stay well clear of automation or touchscreens you will be fine. Another great thing is that they are really easy to fix. Pick a model that’s been going for a long time (eg a [Rancillio Silvia](https://www.wholelattelove.com/products/rancilio-silvia-m-espresso-machine) which has barely changed since the 90s). A good quality machine and mechanical grinder will last decades. Something may break but this is one area where “planned obsolescence “ has yet to sink its claws in (except at the bottom end). This means you are also safe to buy used as it’s very easy to get replacement parts. A used Silvia and $800 grinder would easily last 20-30 years if well cared for. You don’t need to buy them both at once you could buy a used Silvia and a decent [hand grinder](https://1zpressotw.com/jmax) (also a great long term purchase) then get a grinder later if you feel you need it (the grinder I linked produces excellent coffee but does take 45s of grinding).  Don’t buy an all in one machine you don’t expect your fridge to cook you dinner so it’s hardly fair to expect a coffee machine to do so many things. As you noticed with the grinder the more features the more there is to go wrong. You would be far better with separate devices if you want them to last long term.   Maintenance for an espresso machine is minimal and very cheap. You do have to back flush and possibly descale occasionally but that takes 10 minutes every 3 months and just takes a small amount of cleaning products.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tu1bwr/coffee_machine_tips_for_a_buyer/i31cfwq/'

And something like those two + an electric kettle for tea is another decent approach to the OP’s request with the BIFL caveats that: - Baratza grinders aren’t well built but they’re very well supported. They will fail but you can reliably get parts and service. - Breville machines are most certainly not BIFL especially when compared with say scoring a deal on a used La Pavoni,i318oud,/r/Coffee/comments/tu1bwr/coffee_machine_tips_for_a_buyer/i318z73/'

i3114iz,2022-04-01 13:26:56,LEJ5512,tu0h0r,Earplugs for baristas,(Im a musician not a barista)  Look for musicians earplugs.  Theres expensive custom-molded plugs but theres others that are much cheaper.  Earasers and Etymotics are two brands that I have and Ive also got Vibes high-fidelity earplugs on my wishlist.  Any of these reduce the total noise but allows a more balanced sound to come through.  Youll still hear sibilant sounds (s t etc) that youd need to understand speech whereas foam earplugs get rid of those sounds completely.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tu0h0r/earplugs_for_baristas/i3114iz/'

i30emri,2022-04-01 10:52:16,Kuang_Grade_Mark_II,ttwy12,So after a silly comment here prompted me made a no water milk aeropress.,A darker roast I couldn’t really dial in before. Coarser grind than usual so I had a chance of pressing it through. Hoffman Recipe but I doubled the brew time because of the coarser grind.   Pressing was absolutely terrible as anticipated.   Taste is pretty all right. Like a really full milk coffee a lot more flavor than I managed before from those beans.   Could be a super enjoyable milk drink if pressing wasn’t so hard and if you use better beans.   Thanks for the idea u/grendel_x86.   Edit: It’s really hard to press. If you try this silly experiment be careful use a very sturdy mug and be prepared to get frustrated pressing the thing.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ttwy12/so_after_a_silly_comment_here_prompted_me_made_a/i30emri/'

i2zwv5m,2022-04-01 08:56:35,BeanMazz,ttr381,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,Sey Joselino Meneguetti Washed Catucai - Washed coffee from Brazil that placed 3rd in the regional Best of Espirito Santo competition. This is not quite as bright as the recent Sey coffees I’ve posted about here (the Sidra and Peruvian gesha) but it is still impressively sweet and takes on a more floral and deeper citrus tone as it cools. Have been very impressed with the diversity of Brazilian coffees offered by some third wave roasters recently and this Catucai is as good as any of them as far as its light airy sweetness.  [Kiss the Hippo Auromar Gesha](https://kissthehippo.com/products/panama-auromar-gesha?variant=39911661502507) \- Natural gesha from Panama that pushes all the buttons as far as a juicy Panamanian gesha goes - very intense jasmine and mango aroma and sweetness the aroma is almost overpowering without feeling artificial. I usually splurge once or twice a year on special geshas from this roaster because they know how to roast these to get the brightest yet most delicate character out of them. With some other roasters I have to dial them in carefully but this one can be brewed aggressively and yet still have no astringency or off qualities.  [Homeground Mandela](https://homegroundcoffeeroasters.com/pages/varietals-box) \- Over the holidays I purchased a special box of 15g samples of different varietals from the famed Cafe Granja La Esperanza farm offered by this roaster. Working my way through the last of them I was blown away by this hybrid of Caturra with Timor — the notes read meyer lemon kiwi and strawberry soda and the cup actually sparkles with all these notes it basically tastes like a coffee lemonade tonic. Apparently the roaster planted their own Mandela tree on the farm and they certainly seem to have done well on the basis of this outstanding cup.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ttr381/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i2zwv5m/'

I then had the same coffee at a coffee shop.  It was richer and a more buttery-peanut slight butter scotch sweet coffee - more traditional then the brighter cleaner coffee I was brewing.  After that coffee shop brew of it I tried a lower water coffee 15:1 with more mineral content water. I got close to the coffee shops brew of this coffee although not as strong nut taste and not as sweet but close although mine was more clean and had a slight bitter-lemon edge to the last few sips after it cooled more.  Overall this is a good clean Ethiopian coffee with tea-like properties and lemon finish.

Saw a couple people discussing it last week and agree that this was one of Seys better coffees I had recently. Sweeter than normal with classic strong citrus and acidity.

[Altos de Marfil washed processed Ecuador](https://sweetbloomcoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/altos-de-marfil) from Sweet Bloom out of Lakewood Colorado. This one grew on me towards the end with that classic Sweet Bloom sweetness from a number of areas.

[Uru Shimbwe Co-Op washed Tanzania](https://sweetbloomcoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/uru-shimbwe-co-op) from Sweet Bloom.

This is an example of one of those an anaerobic natural from East Java which sounds…different. It’s a pretty rum-forward cup of coffee and the ferment note is somewhat heavy. You do kinda get the chocolate and on its best days you could get banana on the nose. It is also slightly earthy. I guess on the bright side it’s distinctly rum-“flavored” and not just straight alcohol. It’s pretty much exactly how I expected this coffee to taste. Obviously not the greatest imo but certainly not the worst.  [Las Brumas Gesha](https://elixrcoffee.com/collections/elixr/products/ernesto-menendez-finca-las-brumas-el-salvador) from Elixr: Sometimes Geshas are really amazing and other times they taste merely as good as a regular specialty coffee. This one falls in the latter group for me. You can get a little of the peach note that to me resembles the juice in canned peaches but it’s rather underwhelming. There’s a chance I’m not getting the most out of this coffee but even when I try to overextract it on purpose it still feels a little empty.  An underwhelming coffee week for me personally but I made a splurge on a couple of Panamanian Geshas I’m really excited about.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ttr381/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i34mtvf/'

My point is Ive purchased a bunch of Gesha and I dont feel the more expensive ones are better than the regular priced Gesha or other good coffee.   An example of what Im trying to explain- Passengers Mario Moreno at $12 for 5 ounces is better than any Gesha Ive ever had. (and some were up to 7 times the price and from the best farms) And the best Gesha Ive had was Pablo Guerrero Gesha from Sweet Bloom. It was double what they usually charge but still not approaching the high prices often charged for Gesha.THAT coffee was great.   Im not putting down expensive Gesha but my experience is regularly priced specially coffee can taste similar or even better than higher priced Gesha. This isnt so much a knock on these expensive Geshas as its a testiment to the quality and taste of other specially coffee.   This doesnt mean Im not splurging on coffee anymore either I have a Gesha from Passenger on the way now. It wasnt super expensive and Im interested to see what they consider spectacular.

i39dpdx,2022-04-03 12:34:14,geggsy,ttr381,[MOD] What have you been brewing this week?/ Coffee bean recommendations,/u/Wendy888Nyc - thanks for your detailed answer to my question!  I’m happy to share my take but I should first start with a caveat: I rarely buy expensive coffee to brew at home.  I’m much more likely to buy expensive coffee (e.g. $10+ a cup) at a cafe and I have done so at notable cafes in Australia Japan Korea and the USA.  This is really due to a confluence of reasons: (i) expensive coffees often have unique atypical flavor profiles that I don’t want to be committed to for a full bag (ii) I’m slow to dial in a coffee and don’t like wasting beans and (iii) my experience is that increased price (after one is already buying high-quality specialty coffee) doesn’t correlate with my enjoyment.  I’m guessing that we have (iii) in common.  As /u/Whaaaooo says coffee is often prized for its uniqueness.  See for example James Hoffmann’s excitement over Yemenia in an older Youtube video of his.  James also mentions that buying more expensive coffee is unlike buying more expensive wine (I think in his video on buying coffee).    For me I got much better enjoyment from coffee brewing and drinking when I better understood what I like in coffee and how to select it (and I’m still learning!).  It also improved a lot when I came to understand extraction and brewing technique better (which happened at the same time).  I think I’m a bit more picky than many - I don’t really enjoy a lot of specialty coffee and many subscriptions have sent me something I don’t particularly like.  So understanding how to select coffee for my preferences has been a much bigger improvement for me than spending more.  That said when I have found the confluence of two things - an expensive coffee that has a flavor profile I enjoy - I have had some truly spectacular cups.  I still vividly remember for example a super-sweet distinctive Colombian gesha I had in cafe a few months ago.  I also however remember a different disappointing Colombian gesha I bought to brew at home.  So I’ll continue to buy exceptional coffee out at cafes.  Maybe one day I’ll also buy a bag of coffee than I have truly enjoyed in-cafe for home brewing.  But what usually happens when I’m out a cafe is that I already have plenty of beans at home so I’m reluctant to buy more (despite being tempted!) so I don’t end up with too much coffee that is getting less fresh by the day!,i38opyi,/r/Coffee/comments/ttr381/mod_what_have_you_been_brewing_this_week_coffee/i39dpdx/'

(love the last paragraph)  >	I think I’m a bit more picky than many - I don’t really enjoy a lot of specialty coffee and many subscriptions have sent me something I don’t particularly like.   Im with you here though Im light years from when I started brewing 2 years ago when I barely even liked coffee.   Having a good cup of specialty in a great cafe is great too Ive experienced this more recently now that going out and traveling is easier. It helps to see whats possible in a good cup. (even if my equipment isnt as high-end) My first v60 in a Denver shop convinced me its not such a big deal to brew in one and I got to taste that sparkling acidity that people love.

I am so glad I have moved on from those!  I enjoyed the coffee I made but I didn’t know how much flavor I was leaving behind.  I also thought ‘single origin’ meant ‘single country’.  Ugh!

I think being kind of housebound for the last 2 years helped me (and likely others) progress quicker than I would have if things were normal. You’re lucky you enjoyed your coffee early on and was just “leaving flavor behind”. I was just making bad coffee lol until I finally figured out my “beginner grinder” didn’t match my ambition of brewing good light roast coffee.  I’m with you on this- I’m also VERY grateful to the people on r/coffee and those great coffee-content guys on YouTube.

Assuming your water heating device is clear of plastic you can do the entire process without ever having your water contact any plastic at all.   And youll get better coffee.  If you insist on using a drip machine they all have plastic components to one degree or another and Technovorm makes a machine that drips into a stainless insulated carafe which is about as close to what youre looking for that youre going to get.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ttpdwe/help_whats_the_best_automatic_coffee_maker_using/i2z55dl/'

i2zby52,2022-04-01 06:31:28,randomroyalty,ttp7f4,To those who use relatively cheap coffee machines what grind size do you use?,Depends. Drip grind size similar to preground.   Most commercial preground coffee grind will differ depending on the roast and the blend. For example McDonalds in a can for drip will be different than Melitta or Folgers.   If you are grinding your own beans you can adjust until you like it.   Brewing full pots you might want to go a bit coarser.   Generally with these machines they brew a bit cooler than optimum but can be pretty good if you preheat and use darker roasts.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ttp7f4/to_those_who_use_relatively_cheap_coffee_machines/i2zby52/'

Some coffee tastes better with mesh. Some coffee tastes better with paper. I even have cloth filters to use for coffees that seem to need something in the middle.  Turned off by fines in your cup? Choose paper. Feel like your coffee is lacking mouthfeel? Choose mesh. High cholesterol? Choose paper.,i2z30io,/r/Coffee/comments/ttp7f4/to_those_who_use_relatively_cheap_coffee_machines/i2z3u3m/'
i3054z8,2022-04-01 09:50:47,randomroyalty,ttp7f4,To those who use relatively cheap coffee machines what grind size do you use?,No I would adjust grind for the roast and maybe how much you are brewing .   Nothing wrong with experimenting with pre-ground to see if you get better results. If you have a favourite bean from a coffee shop get them to grind a small quantity at different settings ( their recommended a bit coarser and a bit finer). Try a full pot then a half pot for each grind.   For best results I would do the following:  Descale the machine   Clean the carafe and the filter holder  Use a “white” paper filter No brown or bamboo Melitta preferably (cheap) and rinse it first.  Never use the carafe to fill the reservoir but a pitcher preferably filtered or use spring water (optional depends on your tap water).   Try and keep the amount of ground coffee you use consistent. If you use a scoop it should be level not heaping. A scale is more accurate if you have one (55g coffee per litre or 18:1 water to coffee by weight).   Preheat the machine (and carafe if you have a thermal one). You may not need to do this for a full pot but you should for a half pot.   Medium to lighter roasts typically taste better when the coffee cooled down a bit. Dark roasts taste better when hotter.   Keep notes and if you hit on a grind you like you can grind your own to the same size.   If you don’t like any of it (too strong too weak astringent/acidic or bitter) you can adjust the quantity of coffee but generally this is a sign the machine is too fast or too slow or the wrong brew temp.   I’m not sure what machine you have but generally with big capacity machines (eg 12 or 14 cup) the water temp is too low by the time it hits the grounds.  Smaller capacity machines make better coffee (Cuisinart 4 cup makes excellent coffee for example).,i2zkq8e,/r/Coffee/comments/ttp7f4/to_those_who_use_relatively_cheap_coffee_machines/i3054z8/'

The Ode with v1.1 burrs makes clearer cups with more sparkle. The JX Pro makes nice rounded cups with decent clarity although its easier to get a hint of bitterness if the brew goes on too long compared to the Ode. The Niche is very meh for filter coffee.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ttnuku/1zpresso_kplus_vs_electric_grinders/i2z49xt/'
i2yw9tj,2022-04-01 04:12:10,bmiller201,ttnuku,1zpresso K-plus Vs electric grinders,I personally think the fellow ode is over priced for what it does.  The niche zero is about 2x the price of your hangrinder but you get a grinder that will practically be the last one you would ever need to buy. (Especially for home use).  And the wilfa uniform. Ive heard some meh things about the grinder overall its not bad but once again you got a better grinder with the kplus still.    I have the jx pro for filter and espresso and its still more consistent than I think the wilfa.  My next grinder will definetley be electric but Im waiting to see if I get a proper machine or not first.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ttnuku/1zpresso_kplus_vs_electric_grinders/i2yw9tj/'
i2z4xxg,2022-04-01 05:35:28,Salty_Earth,ttnuku,1zpresso K-plus Vs electric grinders,Interesting thanks.

The blue horse mod to my skerton for £15 (which Im finding is sticking a lot and grinding inconsistently even at the coarseness recommended for v60)?   Or a timemore c2 for £60?  I hate waste and my skerton has served me well for aeropress for a long time so I was leaning towards modding if its a big improvement. But the piece of metal is half the price of the grinder itself which seems a bit crazy! So I wonder if Im better off just upgrading to a steel burr grinder.  Please note several of the other recommended manual grinders are much more expensive than the timemore in the UK usually topping £100.

i30d6ut,2022-04-01 10:42:41,braindeadwolf,ttn1z4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,As someone with a K-Pro and a Timemore C2 max you probably arent going to be able to tell much of a difference in grind quality for your purposes. Things like grind speed quality and other quality of life upgrades are what you would notice. If you move up to a JX-Pro youll get all that I just mentioned but also have the capability of espresso.  This is just my opinion though and Im sure others would disagree. But to me if you like what you have now you already hit the good range of grinding and I doubt youd feel it was worth it if you upgraded taste wise.,i2zzhv8,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i30d6ut/'
i30dqhd,2022-04-01 10:46:21,wipny,ttn1z4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,This was my answer in your mod deleted post:  The JX Pro has a larger 48mm burr with a finer grind adjustment that makes it better for dialing in espresso. It also has the adjustment dial at the top vs bottom.   The description for the Timemore C2 Max says it has plastic internal stabilizers while the 1zpresso is entirely metal machined from one block of aluminum.   For pour overs and such your Timemore is perfectly fine. No need to spend extra money for something you don’t need.,i2zzhv8,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i30dqhd/'

If you mean total brew time I find that with a larger amount the thicker coffee bed will provide more resistance and give you a longer brew timely which is okay and should only be partially offset by a coarser grind i.e. 4 minutes is fine. The same thing applies in theory to smaller brews i.e. grind a bit finer and brew a bit quicker although I find that other methods with multiple pours work better for 200g recipes.,i2yqty9,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2ysng4/'

i2z8lmk,2022-04-01 06:05:24,MikeTheBlueCow,ttn1z4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Youve already identified the issue its the grinder. It is not designed for light roast specialty coffee. Look into a Timemore C2 or better.,i2z4sr6,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2z8lmk/'
i2z7so6,2022-04-01 05:59:04,bostoncreampuff,ttn1z4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I feel your pain it took me a long while before I was getting consistently good cups. I think specialty coffee is just like every other hobby it takes time to master the necessary skills.   If you are using a scale to measure out your beans then I am pretty sure your issue is with the grinder  I think most Hario have ceramic burr sets which can gives wildly inconsistent grind sizes. This would explain how it can be bitter and sour at the same time as some bigger particle gets under extracted and smaller particle gets over extracted. I would suggest grind slower with consistent speed and tilt your grinder 45 degrees to slowly feed the beans into the burr. Also grind finer and use less brew time as I have found that finer is a bit more consistent.  The awful bad taste that lingers sounds like overextraction try decreasing your brew time.  By a far margin your grinder is the greatest limiter to your cup  so perhaps consider an upgrade if you decide to pursue this further!,i2z4sr6,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2z7so6/'

i2ztkju,2022-04-01 08:34:35,Kuang_Grade_Mark_II,ttn1z4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I made some tasty brews with a hario and the aeropress with light-medium roasts.   I had some terrible ones too.   Sticking to a single recipe (the Hoffman one) and dialing in the grinder (I ended on 6-7 klicks with light-medium roasts) helped.   I pressed way too hard in the beginning and managed to make „ashen water“ or bitter and sour at the same time.   Rewatching James video and trying to improve my technique really helped.   Took me around 15 brews to get okay and around 30-40 to get good.,i2z4sr6,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2ztkju/'

i2z91bj,2022-04-01 06:08:53,MikeTheBlueCow,ttn1z4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,The JH method was designed to fill the V60-02 to the top. I do not believe youll get the best results by modifying the approach the way you described it will lead to grinding too coarse for a good extraction. You should either get the larger V60-03 or change the structure of the recipe. I would look up larger recipes for V60 and see what they do differently - its likely multiple pours rather than a 2-stage continuous pour.,i2ywngy,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2z91bj/'
i2z99a6,2022-04-01 06:10:39,_Insider,ttn1z4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yes  but youd only go a bit coarser and also brew a bit longer maybe aiming for a 4 minute drawdown while your original 30g grind size might give you a 5 minute drawdown. But youd probably need a larger V60 for that or a different method I find that 500g of water is the max in the 02 with the Hoffmann method.,i2ywngy,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2z99a6/'
i2z6uyg,2022-04-01 05:51:23,MikeTheBlueCow,ttn1z4,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yes in any pour over or percolation style method that grind size controls the rate of draining through the coffee bed.  Recipes are always just starting places so really I dont recommend  trying to adhere to a strict recipe... but as a starting point do a bloom (3:1) then make a pour that brings you to 10:1 then pause 30 seconds and make a pour that brings you to your final volume. Do minimal agitation during the bloom I prefer no swirling and instead just gentle mixing with a chopstick without touching the sides. No agitation could also be fine. After each of the larger pours I do a gentle swirl around. Thats about it. I do 15-20g brews with this and find its a great general approach for really any bean Ive come across. Final brew time and grind size depends on your grinder and the coffee youre brewing but Im in the 3-4 minute range usually.,i2ywbq3,/r/Coffee/comments/ttn1z4/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2z6uyg/'

i34396x,2022-04-02 07:49:27,DeBray3,ttmyj4,What small change has the biggest impact on your brew?,The sea salt trick with my French press has changed the game  This small amount of sea salt takes away the acidic properties of coffee. Salt being more basic lowers the pH level of the coffee. The coffee barely being more acidic than water. This change brings out the more subtle notes of the coffee as well as thickening the beverage  The electrolytes within the coffee also help your body retain more water meaning you wont have to use the bathroom as frequently. (Itll still go right through you but the difference is noticable)   Less acidic coffee is also much easier on your teeth. For being a daily coffee drinker my teeth are surprisingly white.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ttmyj4/what_small_change_has_the_biggest_impact_on_your/i34396x/'

i30mn6j,2022-04-01 11:46:43,dawebman,ttmyj4,What small change has the biggest impact on your brew?,The JX is probably fine for medium-fine and courser but the JX-Pro makes it possible to do espresso too. I like how many clicks I get with the pro. I’ve adopted the methodology of making grind size the variable I change before others and I can always find the right click while dialling in. I’d imagine if you you had less clicks (less resolution) you might wish you had a click between two clicks to find the perfect setting. Of course there are many people that prefer to adjust water temp or contact time etc over grind size. Or they may change two variables to achieve what they are going for but going up and down clicks is so easy and consistent with the JX-Pro. It’s honestly a joy to use. I don’t mind changing brew methods and having to change the grind size because I know its easy to get back to the last setting. I never wanted to do this with a lesser grinder because I knew the likely hood of getting back to the previous grind size was going to be difficult. Its made it easier to explore in a methodical way and notice changes a long the way. Love it!,i30hglw,/r/Coffee/comments/ttmyj4/what_small_change_has_the_biggest_impact_on_your/i30mn6j/'

The Kalita 155 is small so you cant get much liquid in at once like you can with a V60.  In my recent pourovers with 15g of coffee the water in the V60 never gets higher than about a third of the way up. Its a much slower more controlled brew. I never let it drain down completely just add 10 to 20 ml of water every five to ten seconds after the initial bloom and swirl until I get to between 240 and 250 ml.,i2z7soo,/r/Coffee/comments/ttmyj4/what_small_change_has_the_biggest_impact_on_your/i2zd7v0/'

i3io021,2022-04-05 10:52:40,Blind_Pierre,ttmyj4,What small change has the biggest impact on your brew?,Ive had or have all those minus the Cuisinart. Sharing my take in case it helps.   Comandante: noticeable improvement from my Encore. I wasnt planning on upgrading but got a deal. Looking back I think I wouldve wanted to upgrade at some point for filter. I got red clix for it to be my espresso grinder but then sold it to get the...  JX Pro: honestly dont have a ton of use from it yet because its a travel/espresso grinder. But its been great whenever Ive used it. Looks good feels great and I think it feels ergonomically better than Comandante at least for me. Havent noticed a huge difference in the coffee it makes vs Comandante which tracks with a lot of other comments. Comandante may be slightly better or desirably different than the JX but aside from the status symbol of a Comandante the quality difference is less than the price gap.   Ode: I did upgrade to SSP multipurpose (with silver knight coating but thats negligible) pretty soon after the stock version came in. As stock it was a noticeably different taste in the coffee. Sweeter and Id say more complex. But grinding for a single dose light roast filter brew does push the limits of how fine it goes and you dont have many options for adjustments. I could have worked with it but I make coffee enough so I wouldve upgraded at some point because it wouldve been too frustrating at some point.   With SSP its been incredible. Diagnosing issues are super easy now because the points I need to adjust like grind stand out because of the confidence in the grind being unquestionably good. Changes in grind are noticeable and theres a lot less variable noise going on when dialing in because everything else is uniform. Ive brewed cups that miss the mark or dont hit the sweet spot but I dont think Ive brewed a bad cup since getting the new burrs.   That said some of the workflow critiques have merit. It is a messy grinder if you dont spritz/lightly wet the beans to reduce static. It may be more true for the Ode than others but its standard practice for me and the Ode has been super clean.   Catch lid is poopy. Or at least its of the more unpleasant parts to work with even if its not bad. It just could be nicer and I hear theyre working on all alternative. Annoying it wasnt right from the start.   Retention is minimal but that has an asterisk with it. Its minimal if you make sure its all out. Especially with some of the beans having a bit of moisture for static reduction I got in a habit of starting the grind with the hopper lid off to make sure all the beans went in the chute. Then after the auto off it usually needs a thwack and then a bit more grinding for the rest. I always smack the top and hit the knocker a few times before pulling the cup away and I rarely have any retention.   The magnetic cup is really fun to be honest. Very satisfying how it snaps back into place and you dont have to worry about eyeballing it to line it up.    Overall those three options are all fantastic. I would definitely endorse the JX in general because that level of price to performance is rare. For the electric it sounds like an Ode would definitely be a line drive in terms of upgrading especially if youre thinking SSP burrs. I dont know what youve already considered but consider hitting a single first with the JX to see if you need another go at bat. Lighter on the wallet but more importantly I think the JX and the Ode are a great complementary manual-electric pairing. Ode wouldnt necessarily replace the JX depending on your needs. So less up front cost still getting quality grinds and a future upgrade into the electric world wouldnt make it obsolete. Plus you might end up appreciating the difference even more.   Might be more than you need but Im in the bathroom at work so what else am I gonna do?,i3032y2,/r/Coffee/comments/ttmyj4/what_small_change_has_the_biggest_impact_on_your/i3io021/'

i3k6477,2022-04-05 16:56:12,LEJ5512,ttmyj4,What small change has the biggest impact on your brew?,Thanks for the toilet break writeup! Lol  The Commandante’s reputation (and I think better burr steel?) keeps it on my list but honestly sometimes it feels like 1Z has passed it by in terms of features and maintenance.  I can’t help but think that 1Z’s all-metal construction is just better than the C40’s multi-piece plastic supports.  ~~Do you wish you had gotten one of the top adjustment models instead of the bottom-adjusted JX?~~ Edit- I misread obviously so I should ask do you prefer the top-side adjustment on the JX Pro then?  I think I’d be fine with using the Ode with a little dab of water (and maybe an alignment if needed I like to tweak just for peace of mind).  I’ve also started wondering about Urbanic who’s using motors a hundred watts stronger than the Ode’s.  But the compact size quiet(er) noise and simple design of the Ode sure make it appealing.  I figure I wouldn’t need more than 80g at a time either (well maybe 90).,i3io021,/r/Coffee/comments/ttmyj4/what_small_change_has_the_biggest_impact_on_your/i3k6477/'

Thinner would mean that youd have to grip it harder to work against the same amount of input force (thinking of the axle as the fulcrum and the grinder arm and shell as the two sides of the lever) while thicker requires less grip but go too thick and itll be hard to hold anyway.,i3109ev,/r/Coffee/comments/ttmyj4/what_small_change_has_the_biggest_impact_on_your/i311tsw/'

Coarser grind than usual so I had a chance of pressing it through. Hoffman Recipe but I doubled the brew time because of the coarser grind.   Pressing was absolutely terrible as anticipated.   Taste is pretty all right. Like a really full milk coffee a lot more flavor than I managed before from those beans.

i35ot7e,2022-04-02 15:13:36,Zealousideal_Talk768,ttmyj4,What small change has the biggest impact on your brew?,Yeah - its enough for ME - right now.  I started drinking coffee while in the Navy (in Hawaii - the Chocolate Macadamia Nut Coffee lol) and just used a brewer like a Mr Coffee for years. After being out of the Navy for about 5 years I graduated to a French Press for about 5 years then used a Nespresso (that I still have for when Im in a hurry) for several years.   Then I read an article about the best way to brew coffee and saw the Moka Pot - and remembered being served a little cup from a Moka Pot when I was sitting down with the Puerto Rico National Guard negotiating a contract and that coffee was very strong but delicious and not bitter. Sooo - I bought a Moka Pot. Then a cheap hand burr grinder. Then the Vevok.  Im pretty new along the road to really good coffee so only six grind settings is fine right now. I find the freshness and roast of the coffee beans even more important than a precisely dialed in grind - at least for the Moka Pot. If I move on to a pourover or something else Ill likely have to upgrade the grinder - but for now I like the solid durability and reliability of the reasonably priced Vevok compared to the cheap ($18) original grinder I bought that had plastic parts in it supporting the ceramic burr the plastic parts broke prompting the quick search for a new grinder.

i2wbano,2022-03-31 13:50:43,Anomander,tt8xit,Grinding at different temperatures,>I understand why this might be beneficial but can some explain how?  The idea of heating your burrs is that they then *wont* heat during use.*  Burrs will change size and shape as they heat due to usage which will then throw off your dial-in.  The idea behind heating the burrs is that despite heat being bad for coffee you can increase your shots consistency over the day by getting them up to temperature in advance.  Theres no benefit to heating outside of that if anything its the opposite - beans grind better while colder.  However cold/frozen beans are not possible or reasonable to try and maintain in a cafe setting so instead you set your grinders temperature settings according to how hot your burrs would get during peak usage regardless and not based on the coffee - heat for your burrs is not part of dialling in it is entirely about ensuring that your dial-in remains consistent over the day.  \* Yes technically they will still heat.  However if starting at room temp will consistently add ten degrees over the day adding ten degrees at the start of the day doesnt result in twenty degrees.  More heat will shed heat faster than a smaller amount and it takes more and more energy to increase temperature to higher points.  There is a happy balance point where your grinder will not accumulate more heat beyond the pre-heating allows you to reach that point at the start of the day and then maintain it.  What number that will be will depend on your volume and the exact conditions the grinder is installed in - room temperature available airflow etc.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tt8xit/grinding_at_different_temperatures/i2wbano/'
i2w9hvc,2022-03-31 13:39:27,DonkeyWorker,tt8xit,Grinding at different temperatures,Its getting into Ocd coffee nerd territory. The science of replicating the perfect cup of coffee. The temperature of the burrs will have some affect at a micro level on the grind size I think it would be such a miniscule amount though that think it pretty much a gimmick. For ultimate  consistency of grind youd always grind with the burrs at the same temperature. But then youd also store the beans at a consistent temperature and then theres humidity to consider etc  Exaggerating the effect imagine you were grinding cold damp coffee beans with a cold grinder and pestle. Compared to grinding warm dry coffee beans with a hot  grinder and pestle.   But I think Im actual use it would make a very minimal difference compared to how you store the beans and the grind setting of the machine etc.   But I am but a mere beginner with a modest set up so may be underestimating this wizardry,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tt8xit/grinding_at_different_temperatures/i2w9hvc/'

Im guessing at certain temperatures its better to grind a natural on and other temperatures will be better suited for grinding washed? Or higher altitudes? Density? But does anyone know?

i3n33n9,2022-04-06 09:02:29,yahat,tt5d4h,Coffee Beef Broth?,I have the gene that finds cilantro to be soapy and yet...  I find cilantro to be more aromatic and I enjoy it?  But if you asked me yes or no do I find cilantro to be soapy Id have to say yes.  I have had such mixed feelings about anaerobics generally theyre hit or miss.  I used to be really excited about coffee back in the day reading books working at a cafe yet visiting different ones everyday.  Now I feel like an old jaded coffee afficionado.  I once bought every Gesha now I walk in and get a drip if the coffees good.  Ive grown an appreciation for simpler coffees and (nice) lagers amid the pandemic I dont recognize myself.  Except for that jaded bit.  Anyways when anaerobics started coming in droves I was really excited and liked a lot of them when I first tried them.  But now I find they all taste like shoyu and overripe bananas.  My biggest question for myself is whether I had appreciated these notes before and understood them differently but as I tasted more of them found the novelty less exciting and understood their flavour for what they really are.  Or maybe my taste buds have changed even though I never had COVID.  The strangest thing even though I do love Ethiopians I find them less exciting as I once did I find Kenya and Burundi coffees really hit my groove now.  Had a coffee from Mexico that blew my mind recently.  I think Im just over the hype of speciality coffee in general?,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tt5d4h/coffee_beef_broth/i3n33n9/'

i2wapza,2022-03-31 13:47:06,rumuraisin,tt4yl9,Alkaline Water (9.5 pH) for Coffee Brewing?,So buffers resist change in pH and so whenever you add acid to alkaline water the buffer will prevent the acid from changing the pH significantly. So without a buffer your pH may be alkaline as is but when you add the acid from coffee it rapidly makes the whole thing have an acidic pH.

The difference between 20g of beans and 21g or 19g of beans is the difference between the 16.5:1 ratio I usual want (or at least start with while dialing in. Some coffees I like at a slightly higher ratio) and a 15.7:1 or 17.3:1 ratio. Being 2 grams off would swing the ratios to 15:1 and 18.3:1. That produces a very noticeable difference to me.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tt3k0v/how_many_grams_make_a_difference_in_taste/i2vf3zu/'
i2vy1yh,2022-03-31 12:26:05,Minimum_Opinion_7156,tt3k0v,How many grams make a difference in taste?,The answer is it depends. One way to experiment with this is to create your own blend of somewhat polarizing flavour profiles and see what you can taste. I was very surprised that I could detect the difference in adding something like 2 grams of Ethiopian single origin naturally processed beans to something like 16 grams of a fairly standard Colombian blend. However I dont think if I did the same thing in reverse Id necessarily be able to detect the relatively mundane chocolatey notes of the Colombian blend if I were to add 2 grams of it to 16 grams of the Ethiopian unless I maybe swapped that cheaper blend for a single origin naturally processed Brazilian which Ive found to have almost overpowering cocoa related flavours.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tt3k0v/how_many_grams_make_a_difference_in_taste/i2vy1yh/'

Espresso pourover & smaller makers Im careful with but Im less so with my batch brewer (a Moccamaster). Maybe you could avoid the dissatisfaction on her side & just do the prep for her?

i2uw0yb,2022-03-31 08:23:42,CaffeinePundit,tt21ht,Safe to drink sealed bag of coffee beans that have expanded/puff out over time?,This is caused by the coffee putting off gas and is still perfectly fine to drink.  Following a roast beans are usually left to sit for at least 24 hours to “off-gas” or “degas” before being packaged but can still let off gas after this time. If your beans/ground coffee are packaged in a non-vented bag the bag can continue to swell over time. A simple fix that won’t effect the freshness of your coffee is to poke a small pin hole in the top of the bag.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tt21ht/safe_to_drink_sealed_bag_of_coffee_beans_that/i2uw0yb/'

I dont have direct experience with that grinder but you might want to play around with different settings on it and see what range gives you the best uniformity.  You can then pick a recipe that best fits that grind profile.

i2uqzkd,2022-03-31 07:50:34,geggsy,tt1a0c,Is there are correlation between “ease of grinding” and quality in beans?,Harder to grind means higher density of bean which is typically (1) lighter roast and (2) higher growing altitude.

i2vo5oo,2022-03-31 11:22:09,kylekoi55,tt1a0c,Is there are correlation between “ease of grinding” and quality in beans?,Roast is the biggest determinant for ease of grinding.  Regarding density higher density is only somewhat correlative to high quality. There are coffee varieties like Maragogype and Pacamara that are low density regardless of altitude but can be high quality (objectively score high).   Altitude itself is also only somewhat correlative to high density and high quality.  Climatic conditions (especially temperature and diurnal variation) are the biggest determinants for length of maturation which usually correlates with higher density. Altitude is correlative to lower temperatures and higher diurnal variation but there are many other factors (latitude cloud cover topography ocean currents wind patterns etc) involved in determining climate.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tt1a0c/is_there_are_correlation_between_ease_of_grinding/i2vo5oo/'
i2uu6xg,2022-03-31 08:11:47,jaw295,tt1a0c,Is there are correlation between “ease of grinding” and quality in beans?,Not necessarily however specialty-grade beans are typically lighter roast and grown at a higher altitude which in turn means that they will be denser on average and therefore require more force to grind. Often commercially available beans are of a more developed or darker roast and grown a little closer to sea level which makes them less dense and therefore requires less effort to grind.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tt1a0c/is_there_are_correlation_between_ease_of_grinding/i2uu6xg/'

i2uvgjh,2022-03-31 08:20:04,LEJ5512,tsxh3c,moka pot not even half full,General rules:    Always fill the grounds basket to the top and don’t pack them.  You want enough resistance to add a little pressure no room for water to swirl freely yet not clog the filter screen.  Fill the boiler no higher than the safety valve.  If you want more output to fill a bigger drinking cup either get a bigger pot or dilute with hot water like an americano.  You can under-fill the boiler if you want to tweak the grounds:water ratio though.  Use medium-low heat just enough to make it brew but not so much that it spits wildly at the end.  If you want to speed it up you can boil water and add it to the base first.  (I also sometimes start with High heat and then turn it Off as soon as the base begins to hiss but I need a quiet kitchen)  The very beginning of the brew should look nice and dark.  It’ll turn lighter towards the end as the grounds have less solids to dissolve.  If you run a second brew with the same grounds you’ll see how weak it is (and how harsh it tastes).  You can probably get a sweeter taste by either stopping the brew early or using less water.  If… IF… the brew isn’t smooth and it sputters and spits with very little output there’s either a problem with the gasket OR the grounds funnel isn’t fitting properly in the boiler.

i2u28ub,2022-03-31 04:30:14,Epse,tsxh3c,moka pot not even half full,I dont think youre doing much wrong. I have used both the absolute tiniest and largest moka pots and generally theres a slight bit of murky water left in the bottom and the top is indeed not even half full. When I was doing some recipe testing with my supposedly *2 cup* moka pot I managed to get all the water through and it still didnt reach the halfway point (not to mention being nowhere near enough for two cups). It seems to me that the tops are for whatever reason much bigger than the bottoms.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tsxh3c/moka_pot_not_even_half_full/i2u28ub/'

i2utkaa,2022-03-31 08:07:37,rolodexrobot,tsxh3c,moka pot not even half full,Ive had this problem twice before. First time I was tamping the coffee in too hard into the basket. Youre not supposed to do that you just drop the coffee in with a spoon and let it heap then put the top on. Second time a few months later I had the same problem but wasnt tamping the coffee anymore. After a few tries and getting minimal output I realised the basket had a small hole in it. How it formed I dont know. So I realised it must have been losing pressure during the cook process.

i33exse,2022-04-02 03:47:31,Icefoxed,tsxh3c,moka pot not even half full,I recently got a bialetti moka pot and I think this might be normal! I usually fill the chamber to roughly 1/3 of the way before the valve to yield 2 shots of espresso. I usually take it off the heat when the liquid coffee has stopped running and foam starts to form (not crema just air and leftover water). Then i run the bottom of the pot under cold water to lower the heat before pouring. Afterwards im left with about 1/8th of the water in the chamber which Im assuming is normal as it hasnt affected the taste of my coffee.  Edit: I also use boiled water before brewing. I find that this is quicker and doesnt leave a bitter taste. This is probably because the coffee grind doesnt have enough time to cook and produce unwanted flavours.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tsxh3c/moka_pot_not_even_half_full/i33exse/'
i2upx4q,2022-03-31 07:43:31,communityneedle,tsxh3c,moka pot not even half full,You really wouldnt want all the water to come through.

i36bfah,2022-04-02 19:19:57,LEJ5512,tsxh3c,moka pot not even half full,>Edit: I also use boiled water before brewing. I find that this is quicker and doesnt leave a bitter taste. This is probably because **the coffee grind doesnt have enough time to cook** and produce unwanted flavours.  This is false info basically bro-science and Hoffman learned as much in his latest moka pot series of videos (in which he used a Franken-moka with temperature sensors built by the guy who [made this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObkjKlJe68A&t=274s)).  It does make a difference though in that starting with cool water in the base means that the grounds bed sees lower-temperature water at the beginning which means less extraction.  Starting with hot water means that the grounds see higher temperatures throughout the cycle and get more extraction.  (edit to add on) I think this is why traditional moka is made with finer grinds and darker roasts — easier to get more extraction with those grounds at the lower temps you get with a cool start.  Preboiling the water isnt the traditional method and would extract dark roasts to the point of bitterness but works better for medium and lighter roasts.  (then again part of the traditional recipe includes adding some sugar to the cup),i33exse,/r/Coffee/comments/tsxh3c/moka_pot_not_even_half_full/i36bfah/'

i2v1usi,2022-03-31 09:01:03,LawnRookie,tsxh3c,moka pot not even half full,It doesnt steam and gurgle like in the video. First it trickles out stops for a while then the rest comes out - then it steams and gurgles. I mean I often use a finer ground than Im supposed to and I use the reservoir half-full so that might be why... but I have no complaints about the cuppa it makes.  My best guess is that theres for whatever reason an initial surge in pressure and then a drop. It might be that the grounds temporarily block the outflow because I do find them compressed against the upper filter plate half the time ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.,i2utbp1,/r/Coffee/comments/tsxh3c/moka_pot_not_even_half_full/i2v1usi/'

The coffee is stored in a separate fridge in airtight plastic zip bags but not vacuumed. Surprisingly the medium and dark roasts keep their freshness for quite a long time (havent tried storing more than 3 months but those that have been there for 3 months taste as fresh as few weeks after roasting not a even a bit stalled). With lighter roasts there were some issues. The light-roasted beans obtained some characteristics that caused bitterness or extra sourness. Is it because light-roasted coffee somehow can absorb moisture easier? Has anyone else got an experience of storing coffee in the fridge? Please share your thoughts.

i2w4qqa,2022-03-31 13:09:13,steelbeerbottle,tswdop,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,There is a James Hoffmann video about best electric gooseneck kettles but it all boils down to quality of life features. You can pay $160 for a fancy Fellow Kettle or find one much cheaper off Amazon. Some differentiating features are going to include flow rate how much time it takes to boil adjustable temperature aesthetics weight distribution of the kettle when pouring etc. I’d recommend giving the video a watch to get a better idea of the different features different kettles offer (at the end of the day they all boil water).,i2vu42n,/r/Coffee/comments/tswdop/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2w4qqa/'
i2xnyvs,2022-03-31 19:42:48,wipny,tswdop,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I enjoy using my Hario Buono 1.2L stovetop kettle. I like the Buono’s iconic design large capacity and contoured handle.   I think the main things you want to focus on are whether you want a stovetop or electric model and the capacity.

i2ws6di,2022-03-31 15:43:56,MikeTheBlueCow,tswdop,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Add all the coffee add as much water as you can fit partway through the brew start draining it and continue to add the rest of the water (or let it drain fully and add the rest of the water for a second steep).   Or do bypass. Make the first steep and add water to the cup.   Or use it as a pour over.  Whichever works for your preferred workflow. Personally I like the Switch better for this use case since you dont have to move it around and its easier to use it as a pour over for the second half of the brew.,i2w2ml8,/r/Coffee/comments/tswdop/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2ws6di/'

i2yucqn,2022-04-01 03:49:58,MikeTheBlueCow,tswdop,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Its a good grinder but that doesnt mean its the best grinder for everyone. What are you planning on using it for? To me it works well for espresso where you want to prioritize body and rounder flavors like chocolate. Its not ideal for light roasts or for pour overs though it can still do them I just dont think its the best option for those and there are other good grinders that cost less or similar to the Niche that can handle those options better.  The Niche shines in its user experience. Its near zero retention its not messy its not the most difficult to clean and its overall a good grinder. If it could just produce a bit less fines it would be significantly better for pour over and light roasts. But since it isnt... I think its worth looking into flat burr grinders for those.,i2y9h1i,/r/Coffee/comments/tswdop/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2yucqn/'

i2wghzc,2022-03-31 14:24:18,realplyx,tswdop,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Not in a true sense of the word espresso. You can get decent results but that still requires you to put in effort in diagnosing how your specific machine works such as: volume in a shot at a given setting grind dosage.  But that kind of defeats the purpose of a super auto as you still have to spend time analyzing how to maximize your “espresso” at least in my opinion.  Although even with all this conjecture you might find that the results of a super auto are enjoyable regardless. I can’t say what will happen in that regard though as to say that you will or will not like something here would be erroneous.  My personal purchase would be a very nice drop machine with a manual lever machine for the weekends.,i2w43xx,/r/Coffee/comments/tswdop/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2wghzc/'

Silicone is fine up to >200 celcius which should be plenty.   Then use a compass to mark out the size and a craft knife to cut a ring out.

i2ua2my,2022-03-31 05:45:15,VibrantCoffee,tsrpl6,Where can I find discussion and reviews of commercial espresso machines?,I suppose I never really talk to anyone about it honestly. After being in the industry long enough and repairing our own machines as well as machines at wholesale accounts I have gotten to know what I like and dislike about a decent range of machines.  With just about all of the higher end machines the actual performance and durability is never an issue. What you should be more worried about is who can fix the machine (how far away they are if they have parts in stock or can get them quickly if they have a back-up machine they can swap in if they need to take yours away for a major repair).,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tsrpl6/where_can_i_find_discussion_and_reviews_of/i2ua2my/'

Yeah that makes sense. But if I could afford a La Marzocco I probably wouldnt be making this post! Im more budget conscious than Id like to be because a. Im in Vietnam and b. covid made all the tourists leave so Ill be looking at low profits over the next 6 months to a year. On the other hand its an amazing time to expand my business because I can lock in a 5 year contract with really cheap rent. Also theres a huge market for barely used 2nd hand machines right now as many other businesses have shut down (probably was even better a year ago but still).   So basically while I can be quite flexible on budget Im aiming for something in the $3000 -> $5000 dollar range and Im trying to answer questions like is there really a big difference between a Nuova Simonelli Appia and Aurelia? Enough to make me choose a 2nd hand Aurelia over a new Appia? (using Nuova Simonelli as an example other brands Im researching and which are popular and easily serviced here are Rancilio Wega Astoria Casadio Faema and Exrobar).,i2ua2my,/r/Coffee/comments/tsrpl6/where_can_i_find_discussion_and_reviews_of/i2xajiv/'
i2x8he0,2022-03-31 17:44:34,esperalegant,tsrpl6,Where can I find discussion and reviews of commercial espresso machines?,Yeah Synesso keeps coming up in my research. Unfortunately I cant find anywhere that sells them here (Vietnam). Most types of machine are available but theres a couple of brands - Synesso Rocket La Pavoni Elektra Slayer and Franke - that seem to be entirely absent from the market.   Slayer and Victoria Arduino are way out of my budget unfortunately.   As for stuff thats popular so much of it is Chinese like Gemilai or Italian but manufactured in China like La Carimali. Most popular of all is Casadio - every 2nd cafe seems to have a Casadio Undici. Which are really cheap but I dont know anything about the brand (its yet another Gruppo Cimbali brand probably made in China and I guess its their budget brand).   The well known brands that are relatively common here are Nuova Simonelli Rancilio Faema and Wega so Im planning to get one of those.,i2w1s4q,/r/Coffee/comments/tsrpl6/where_can_i_find_discussion_and_reviews_of/i2x8he0/'

I try to avoid using FB but I guess I can venture into the lions den for a while to get the treasure I need.   As for servicing for sure I will not get a machine unless there is someone who can service it nearby. But thats actually something Im less worried about - here in Vietnam you can pretty much always get anything fixed within a couple of hours.

Attributes^ of a roaster maybe but I hesitate on a tiered ranking list. Mainly because it feels like a strong mechanism for gatekeeping and paying benefit to incumbents. In that light I like the motto of the whiskey vault “the best whiskey is the one you like the way you like it”.  There’s also a lot of non-taste notes that I could see being valuable such as profit sharing with producers sustainable practises size of business etc.  For me coffee is a wonderful social experience and vaguely meditative. Talking about it with friends and strangers alike is arguably part of the fun. Tiered ranking to me at least feels like it would potentially diminish that.  ^ Even attributes are being gamified though… see tasting notes *cough cough*.,i2swep2,/r/Coffee/comments/tspbjt/is_a_roaster_tier_list_acceptable_in_rcoffee/i2t3uoo/'

Darkest I like to go is around City Roast+ basically just before first crack. The cup should be rich and have lots of sweetness and chocolate notes. If its bitter it should be bitter like dark chocolate. Any further than that and you get burnt bitter notes which are less good.   As a rule if the bean has extensive oil on it its a no go for me.   On the flip-side since youre discussing espresso I find it *is* possible to go *too* light in espresso shots and have them turn out well. The acidity can be overwhelming even when it comes out right. Those very light roasts also do not jive well with milk imo.   How dark were your beans before?,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tsbikz/if_youre_struggling_to_make_coffee_that_isnt_too/i2s5u59/'

It is frequently the catch-all use for aging less vibrant tasting coffee and frequently made of “the least expensive options we can find” to make a blend. It is frequently just roasted to color not roasted for specific tastes. These problems are not always the case but they very frequently are. You will almost never find a very fine coffee in a regular grocery store and I would bet your odds are even worse if youre looking at dark roast.  Best is to find a roaster who makes great coffee PERIOD and also loves dark roast. If you make it as drip you will want to extract in the 202-205°F zone.  Anything below 200°F and youre leaving too much behind to compensate for the fact that you don’t like the coffee.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tsbikz/if_youre_struggling_to_make_coffee_that_isnt_too/i2uhh0l/'

A well extracted dark roast will still usually be bitter. Its the kind of bitterness similar to what most people think of when it comes to coffee that has like a partially burnt flavor.      The dark roast bitter is something that’s plenty drinkable and has good flavor otherwise. I can sip it but I personally wouldnt want a whole cup. If I put milk and/or sugar to mask the bitterness I can drink it just fine.    Overextracted bitter to me is more of a medicinal/poison kind of bitter flavor. Its something that makes me want to spit it out. Definitely not sippable and its something I would need to take like a shot.

Coffee roasting doesn’t get hot enough to break down caffeine. It actually depends more on the bean/fruit itself and where it comes from than the roast. If anything actually dark roast can have more caffeine since the roasting process does take a bit of mass off the bean resulting in more caffeine for a given weight.,i2sc9cr,/r/Coffee/comments/tsbikz/if_youre_struggling_to_make_coffee_that_isnt_too/i2sctd3/'

You should be able to get some acidity up front and sweetness in the middle and some notes that linger on the tongue. No bitterness at all.

i351jr0,2022-04-02 12:07:16,drdfrster64,tsbikz,If you’re struggling to make coffee that isn’t too bitter to drink alone give lighter roasts a try!,So what is coffee? It’s a bunch of coffee bits floating in water right. When you pull those bits into your water that’s called extraction.  These bits of coffee that extract into your coffee are not all equal. First acids release from the bean first then fats then lastly - carbs. The acids are well acidic aka fruity the fats are nutty and the carbs are bitter.   A well balanced cup has all the acids and fats released and a little tiny bit of carbs. You can think of it as extracting in this order: sour sweet bitter. All of them contribute to the flavor of your cup and balance each other out. If you under extract what you have is a cup mostly of the acids and not much of anything else. As a result your coffee will taste sour and ONLY sour. So sour you might even call it bitter (a common misconception among new tasters).   Multiple different things can increase extraction. Agitation (stirring aggressive pouring of water from the top) water temperature grind size (which increases surface area of extraction) and time. Agitation and time are generally method/brewing device specific so the general advice to fix an under extracted is to just grind finer. Temperature is a way of doing some very fine adjustments but grind size is the number one culprit. Grind size also increases brew time in drip type coffees like espresso/batch brew/V60 but that’s something you don’t really have to worry about rn,i34hxoa,/r/Coffee/comments/tsbikz/if_youre_struggling_to_make_coffee_that_isnt_too/i351jr0/'

But there might be an explanation for this... if you measure your beans by weight youll have more dark roast beans than light roast beans and therefor the dark roast will have more caffeine. If you measure by volume the light roast beans are more dense (likewise with the grinds) and youll get more beans-per-scoop than you will versus a dark roast.    So - brew by weight the dark roast coffee should have higher caffeine. Brew by volume and the light roast will have more.

The issue with this in general is that particle sizes tend to wildly differ which means your going to get some coffee under extracting and some over extracting. I would try the Hoffman method if you can. It works well.  - Depending on the definition of medium roast I would say you could drop your water temperature a bit instead of boiling maybe try 90 C  - Also could be brewing too long. Maybe don’t let it sit so long.  - Also another reason the Hoffman method is good is it helps avoid getting particles in your cup. These particles usually are bitter when you get them on the tongue.,i2s3lwq,/r/Coffee/comments/tsbikz/if_youre_struggling_to_make_coffee_that_isnt_too/i2s5w9i/'

So I ask for a given size and say with an extra shot for a little more spunk then no room so they fill the cup to the top with no room for cream n sugar.  Try saying two shots eight ounces and see how it goes next time.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ts8rzm/do_coffee_shops_make_americanos_different/i2q6y58/'

I tried it with setting 45 before and got a bit of fruitiness back but it was basically iced water with a hint of fruity coffee.   Am I doing something wrong/ missing variables?

i2s9ysj,2022-03-30 17:15:45,OrlandedeLassus,ts2y7d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Im about to pull the trigger on the Flair 58x manual espresso maker and Im trying to decide whether to pair it with the Fellow Stagg EKG or the Hario Buono temperature controlled electric kettle. I watched James Hoffmanns video on temperature controlled goosenecks and he suggested that the pouring mechanics and power efficiency of the Hario are better while the Stagg is quicker slightly cheaper DEFINITELY sexier more intuitive to use more mainstream has PID (the Hario might also have PID but I didnt see that advertised anywhere) and I could play Wormy while I wait for my water to heat. How a kettle pours matters less in the world of manual espresso than in pourover coffee but Id likely make puer tea with this kettle as well. JHs testing showed that the Fellow pours very slowly at \~17g/sec max (the Hario pours at \~43.5g/sec max) but given that I wont be doing anything like French press where I need a large volume of water to be dispensed quickly and both the Flair brew chamber and traditional Chinese teapots are quite small the increased control and precision of a slower pour might be advantageous. As you can probably see Im leaning towards the Fellow but I want to hear what you guys think. If youve experienced either or better both of these temperature controlled electric gooseneck kettles please share your thoughts. Im a college student so a purchase on this scale is a pretty damn big deal and I want to be as informed as possible before I decide.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ts2y7d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2s9ysj/'

i2rt5dm,2022-03-30 15:08:28,bostoncreampuff,ts2y7d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Japanese iced coffee by nature is quite watery and you will always loose some nuances when you go iced. Here are couple of suggestions that might help other then the normal grind finer with hotter water: 1. Up the ratio even more but this gets kind of wasteful. 2. Use a different bean... I generally find that I can get one or two flavor note to show up iced if they are very strong notes to begin with. 3. Use less but colder ice to allow you more hot water. 4. I find a heavy agitation technique (I normally stir constantly for about a minute and a half then let it drain with no bloom) helps to bring extraction to the right level with Japanese iced coffee since its very little water to alot of beans. 5. Or you can try the two minute bloom that Jonathan Gagne likes to bring up extraction.,i2rkeu8,/r/Coffee/comments/ts2y7d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2rt5dm/'

i2psncl,2022-03-30 07:05:33,devnop,ts2y7d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,For some beans that lack body at typical settings I find grinding as fine as I do for manual espresso works a treat. It probably isnt possible for a skerton so you might be limited by the grinder.  I would first try significantly increasing the dose. If that doesnt increase body/strength I would try a hybrid immersion brew - brew in a separate vessel for 2-4 minutes and then pour into the v60.,i2p6moh,/r/Coffee/comments/ts2y7d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2psncl/'
i2qekqh,2022-03-30 09:33:38,wipny,ts2y7d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,What brew ratio are you using? Meaning how many grams of coffee to ml of water? I found a 1:18 ratio perfect for me.   Are you using tap or filtered water? How does your water taste on its own?  What’s your JX’s grind setting? I use around 78 clicks from 0. That’s about 2 whole rotations plus 6 whole numbers.   For Ethiopian natural coffees I found a gooseneck kettle really does help in brewing pour overs.   Even with a good grinder like the JX I’d get inconsistent bitter-sour cups using a regular spout tea kettle. I think the extra agitation and turbulence from a regular spout extracts that bitterness from natural coffees.   So if these other things don’t help I’d consider saving up for a gooseneck. I have a Hario Buono 1.2L that I enjoy using. I know the Hario Air Kettle is a lot cheaper but it’s plastic and more fragile.  Lastly use the [Coffee Compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/app-archive-main/the-coffee-compass/) to help you dial in your grind size and brew ratio.

i2r3d3h,2022-03-30 12:16:04,sensorglitch,ts2y7d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I would go with a french press and hot water.   1. You dont even need a kettle you can just use like a pot to heat water for the french press (multitasker). Also I have seen french presses at like the thrift store.  2. A standard tea spoon is 4.2 grams so 7-8 tea spoons for a 500ml pour. 3. The french press is probably the most forgiving for grind size so if you use a blade grinder you will still get decent coffee. Even if you buy like pre-ground the coffee will be.. passable.,i2pl5tu,/r/Coffee/comments/ts2y7d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2r3d3h/'
i2q5l8g,2022-03-30 08:33:30,chigoku,ts2y7d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,By going coarser youre slowing down extraction. As you have nothing between 9 and 10 you need to adjust your steep time and make it a bit longer so that your coarser grounds extract a bit more. But you dont want to go too long or you will end up with a bitter cup again.   Alternatively you could stick with 9 and a shorter steep time to try to get the same result.,i2pzvdr,/r/Coffee/comments/ts2y7d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2q5l8g/'
i2qb19u,2022-03-30 09:10:12,MikeTheBlueCow,ts2y7d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Maybe the roaster was just recommending the finer grind for actual espresso? It does make sense with an espresso roast to go coarser in a filter method.  As far as dialing in at this point you could pick either 9 or 10 and then just adjust your other variables. If you stick at 10 where it is slightly sour then you can extend your brew time a little maybe increase water temp. If you stay at 9 if its just a little bitter you can use cooler water and maybe even just use less water instead.,i2pzvdr,/r/Coffee/comments/ts2y7d/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2qb19u/'

I would strongly recommend the regular 58 or go with a cheaper flair pro instead.   The Fellows slow flow rate makes it great for pourover but incredibly annoying to use for anything else even making a cup of tea (like 300ml) is tedious.

i31pxpp,2022-04-01 16:35:17,nafixd,ts2y7d,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,So I tried the recommendations and it improved the taste but it still tastes muted on the fruitiness. I tried it with the James Hoffman method in the v60 for hot coffee. I’ve had very enjoyable cups from the Kinu with the same beans. I spoke with a friend and they think it needs to be seasoned.

Today btw i finally got some flavour out of my coffee i tried to pour as gentle as i could it was a bit too long brewtime cuz there was a bit of bitterness and sourness (but not long lasting) but i finally got fruity notes.

i2p4c2a,2022-03-30 03:18:28,jng0714,ts2oi2,Is the ODE with SSP burrs the best grinder setup in that price range ?,The Ode with SSP is the same price as a Vario so it is the natural competitor. The cup taste from each grinder is going to be determined by two main factors (for the sake of simplicity).   The first is Grind shape which is determined by the geometry and design of the burrs themselves. Since these are both flat burrs the grind shape will be in the same league with minor differences. Ultimately it’s personal preference and there is not a clear measurable winner here. There are people who prefer the coffee from SSP over the Vario and vice versa.   The second factor is grind consistency which is co-determined by both the burr design (again) and also alignment. Over the last few years SSP has gained a strong reputation for creating incredibly consistent grinds so I would put them ahead of the Vario burrs. That leaves alignment. How well the burrs can be aligned is determined by manufacturing quality assurance and of course the design of the grinder itself. Both the Ode and Vario will not come meticulously aligned (thanks to mass manufacturing) but the key is that they both *can* *be* aligned by the home user. The Ode is much easier to align. The Vario is harder to align (requires more disassembly) but has pretty thorough guides out there. Overall I’d give the winner to the Ode/SSP combo for consistency.   If you plan to go espresso the Vario is the only choice between the too. Aesthetic wise I think Ode looks way better on countertop. Sound and workflow wise I like the Ode too. Lastly the Ode gives you access to experiment with other aftermarket 64mm burrs down the road (e.g SSPs new cast burrs Gorilla burrs) whereas with the Vario you’re pretty much locked in to Baratza burrs.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ts2oi2/is_the_ode_with_ssp_burrs_the_best_grinder_setup/i2p4c2a/'

i2owykv,2022-03-30 01:32:10,acid-vogue,ts1c9x,Cant get cappuccino foam right,I don’t have experience with your machine but I’ve been a barista and cafe manager and have a commercial grade coffee machine at home.   You may not be getting an enough power from your steam wand. But you should still be able to get cap froth on any machine IMO.   For technique:   Remember coffee is a micro art - use tiny tiny adjustments mere millimetres of movement.   You ideally want your wand in at 1-2 oclock on right hand side of the jug or 10-11oclock on the left pointing just off centre on that side. Maybe gently tip the jug towards you to help if your steam wand needs a bit of assistance.   You want the wand head just below the surface maybe half an inch for your case not too low so it screeches but not too high it sputters milk everywhere you want it sounding like an angry snake “hiss-hssssss-hsssss” while it aerates the milk.  Once it feels warm then lower it. Should take approx 5-10 seconds depending on your machine.   Don’t plunge the wand into the bottom of the jug lower it by tiny tiny increments until THEN it sounds like very gentle soft paper-tearing sounds. It should only be lowered by like an inch max in your case.    Rest the milk for 10 seconds and swirl.   Give your espresso a swirl in your warm cup (rinse in boiling water prior to espresso extraction to help)  then introduce the milk.   This method has always worked for me on any machine with adjustments on times/angles depending on machine.   Hope this helps!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ts1c9x/cant_get_cappuccino_foam_right/i2owykv/'

I say this as Kenyan coffee tends to have a strong stone fruit note which puts me hard off as it tastes like tomato for me. Being acidic is like 12% of what African coffees are.   As a *general* guide for origin notes: Africa - fruity acidic milk chocolate America - nutty caramelly dark chocolate Asia - earthy/umami tart fruits cocoa  I would go for an American like Colombia or Guatamala (my personal fave origin). These tend to be a little more traditional like cups.   Try to find a medium-dark roast (not sure ur area or I might be able to recommend roasters). Some u might be able to find in *most* grocery stores: counter culture Stumptown LA Colombe.

Try grinding finer and/or lengthening your brew time.  >Does anyone have any recommendations of coffee that taste sweet without sugar?  From my experience sugar actually ruins specialty coffee - sugar makes it taste weird. But if you like Frappucinos and things like that you might want to get darker roasts bombarded with sugar as milk hides a lot of the flavors of coffee especially light-roasted ones. No use wasting money on high-quality beans if youre not going to taste the beans themselves anyways.  >A different roast?

i2p59ah,2022-03-30 03:30:37,MarcTes,ts17xc,Learning to taste coffee,Using James Hoffman as a resource is an excellent suggestion.  I don’t use sugar in any coffee I make whether it be cold brew French press or espresso. I have found that high-quality freshly roasted beans are the key (along with the right grinder settings and equipment).  My favorite supplier is Equator which has a broad selection of superb beans with detailed descriptions.  Although they’re located here in the Bay Area (San Rafael) they ship all over. I get weekly deliveries and am very happy with them. Buying directly from the roaster will guarantee the freshest beans possible.  In my experience the sweet spot for starting to use beans is between 4 to 6 days after roast and I finish them within two weeks.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/ts17xc/learning_to_taste_coffee/i2p59ah/'

Kenya is typically quite tame on acidity and bitterness. Watch James Hoffmann on YouTube. You could watch any video of his and still get a decent explanation on how extraction works. He has I believe two videos dedicated to the aeropress which will also help you out.  For coffee that tastes great without the extras personally I’ve only found a couple I didn’t like. My favorites are Kenya and Papua New Guinea Peaberry. Both quite fruity low acidity and bitterness. Mexican is also good not so fruity but very nutty and rich Costa Rican is similar but with a little bit of a fruity profile and lots of nuttiness and richer caramel and chocolate notes.

i2tgmfn,2022-03-30 23:38:33,golden_boy,ts17xc,Learning to taste coffee,Something others here havent explicitly noted here but you may have picked up by now is that solving the acidity problem without overcorrecting into bitter territory is actually the trick to making your coffee taste sweet without added sugar.  Everyone will tell you that sour means grind finer and bitter means grind coarser which is true but you may want to look up the coffee compass which slightly complicates that narrative - for instance sometimes a need to grind finer can make your cup taste watery or thin-bodied instead of acidic.  Im of the opinion that a well prepared medium roast blend with straightforward flavors of e.g. chocolate nuts maybe some graham cracker and honey notes in there sort of thing will be easier to learn with than the fruitier funkier natural processed beans that are especially popular with the hip folks on here. Once youve learned to dial in your grind and make a sweet tasting cup with those more traditional coffee flavors youll be ready to start prepping a good cup with some lighter fruitier roasts (which will invariably require finer grinds but by then you know how to dial in) because a lot of the under/over/sweet spot flavor signals are quite general even if the overall flavor profiles youre aiming for are wildly different. I tried to jump straight into the fruity stuff when I started but didnt really have a frame of reference for what I was aiming for. The medium roast made it easier for me to say confidently okay this tastes bitter that tastes weirdly thin or tangy ooh this tastes like coffee but good but maybe a touch off - oh shit this ones actually sweet those people online werent bullshitting and I was then able to apply those lessons to the funky beans that taste like blueberries.,i2p35rm,/r/Coffee/comments/ts17xc/learning_to_taste_coffee/i2tgmfn/'

First I added a **pressure gauge** so I could adjust the **OPV** (I have the GC version which doesnt use a spring but a screw). I lowered the pressure to 8.5 bar. I learned to use **temperature surfing** to keep temperature differences to a minimum. I bought a **steam wand** because I couldnt whisk the milk properly at all with the original one. Then I bought a **Baratza Sette 270wi** grinder second hand. And last month I bought a **precision portafilter** **precision screen** and **pump dimmer**.

i2pld5r,2022-03-30 06:10:34,IIALE34II,ts0axb,Finally happy,I have a manual grinder too! Add few more years into the mix! But apparently Robot isnt that hard?

i2q0t7i,2022-03-30 08:01:29,Xsichtik,ts0axb,Finally happy,I dont think a basket screen is particularly needed. Its awfully hard to pick just one mod. It seems to me that its been improving step by step. For example naked portafilter is great at detecting if channeling is occurring. Without it I wouldnt have learned to set up the puck better. Lowering the pressure with OPV helped reduce channeling but it wasnt enough on its own. Even a little thing like an insulated mug improved my enjoyment of the coffee by keeping it hot longer.        If you really want advice from me (even though I still consider myself a beginner) buy a naked portafilter. Its not that expensive it will help you improve preparation and possibly spot the problem and it looks nice. :),i2pytn2,/r/Coffee/comments/ts0axb/finally_happy/i2q0t7i/'
i2qmsf5,2022-03-30 10:27:30,Balkal,ts0axb,Finally happy,My biggest upgrades were lowering the pressure but I still had mine at the default pressure for years. That and a vst basket and upgraded shower screen made the biggest differences. These were all pretty cheap changes.  The pressure guage was a little janky I just took the portafilter that it came with managed to get the spouts off took it to home depot asked for help and got some metal tubing that screwed onto the portafilter and then on to a cheapo pressure gauge.   I wouldnt recommend doing that if you dont have another portafilter though because it got jacked in the process a little bit. (I had bought a naked one years ago so the one that came with the machine had been collecting dust.,i2pytn2,/r/Coffee/comments/ts0axb/finally_happy/i2qmsf5/'

i2poysa,2022-03-30 06:38:35,devnop,ts0axb,Finally happy,Heh only joking... sort of. I have a flair and manual espresso is a lot of fun. It didnt take long to get the workflow nailed and create god level shots - mind bending fruit bombs far beyond anything I have ever had from a speciality shop.  However the days before and after god shots I will also create paint thinner. Perfect prep perfect pull... strips the flesh from my face. If not hard means guaranteeing a perfect shot with a difficult bean then... well Im not there yet and I dont know if its even possible. Some days it just doesnt come together and redialling only leads to different flavours of sink shot before I give up. I want to blame atmospheric conditions because its quite inexplicable... or it will take 6 more years :),i2pld5r,/r/Coffee/comments/ts0axb/finally_happy/i2poysa/'

i2qw19o,2022-03-30 11:28:05,Xsichtik,ts0axb,Finally happy,Maybe I misspoke I didnt add the manomentr to the portafilter but attached it to the machine so I can monitor the pressure profile while making espresso.

I do mine in my French press because I don’t make much French press coffee these days.,i2q7800,/r/Coffee/comments/trv9xc/what_to_do_with_a_coffee_i_dont_like/i2q8n41/'

From Wikipedia: Hydrangea flower color changes based on the pH in soil. As the graph depicts soil with a pH of 5.5 or lower will sprout blue hydrangeas a pH of 6.5 or higher will produce pink hydrangeas and soil in between 5.5 and 6.5 will have purple hydrangeas. White hydrangeas cannot be manipulated by soil pH they will always be white because they do not contain pigment for color.,i2pw4nl,/r/Coffee/comments/trv9xc/what_to_do_with_a_coffee_i_dont_like/i2px5qw/'

If youre serious about doing espresso down the road I think its a fine purchase. You could potentially save a lot of money in the long run if it ends up being your end game grinder.   It really can do a good job with both filter and espresso grind sizes. Its not as good as specialist grinders like ek43 youd find at higher end coffee shops mind you but its a good one stop choice for home grinding.   Oh and yeah Ive been noticing I still get some static retention on the grinder but I do the James Hoffman trick where I stir the whole coffee beans with a wet spoon before grinding and that helps a lot.

The niche seems more designed and tailored to making espresso being able to grind for filter seems more secondary to me which doesnt make it so cost-efficient of a purchase to me. You can get the same grind quality for filter in a high quality handgrinder thats much cheaper or if youre lazy you can get an electrical one in the range of 400-500 euros to your liking.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tr2lhw/is_it_dumb_to_get_a_niche_zero_to_primarily_use/i2kqj2k/'

i2ksm1i,2022-03-29 08:48:10,cantrecall,tr2lhw,Is it dumb to get a niche zero to primarily use for filter coffee (hario switch)?,I use a NZ to grind for a drip machine daily.  Like /u/arnoldpettybunk I find the hopper size limitation to be less than ideal.  I grind about 60g a day in two batches.  The difference in taste between 60 and 65 grams is negligible (to me) so a large capacity hopper with timed grinds would be more useful as a daily grinder for drop coffee.  It isnt so much that the Niche cant do drip coffee just that it doesnt shine.  That said Ive been using it this way for 2+ years because I dont want two grinders.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tr2lhw/is_it_dumb_to_get_a_niche_zero_to_primarily_use/i2ksm1i/'

The Niche Zero is very small and it can be a bit of a pain to grind more than 40 or so grams (the hopper only holds 50ish grams and there isn’t much clearance between the chute and the base. I’ve used it a couple times for drip with my Technivorm Mochamaster but it was a pain to have to grind twice (I use 69 grams for a 1.25 L pot) and with the coarser grind settings there is a lot of static. Grind quality was quite good though. But the inconvenience was enough that I went back to my Capresso Infinity for drip while I search out a better dedicated drip grinder,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tr2lhw/is_it_dumb_to_get_a_niche_zero_to_primarily_use/i2klycj/'

i2nih2p,2022-03-29 17:15:54,dbdnt,tr2lhw,Is it dumb to get a niche zero to primarily use for filter coffee (hario switch)?,Yes though I’d say you need to consider more thoroughly what you actually want and need. One grinder for everything sounds great but it ends up not being very practical. I tried to do that with my Vario for a while and it led to a good deal of frustration flipping between espresso and filter ends of the spectrum. Nowadays I use the Vario with steel burrs exclusively for filter and it’s fantastic. I have a hand grinder for travel that also does filter grind great.   The NZ has a whole load of hype but I find it’s best quality to be its workflow for espresso. Criticisms about its taste profile aside it is pleasant to use and easy to dial in. I think its use for filter is not that great compared to alternatives.   Ymmv but don’t fall for any grinder hype. Stay aware of the diminishing returns.,i2kzmci,/r/Coffee/comments/tr2lhw/is_it_dumb_to_get_a_niche_zero_to_primarily_use/i2nih2p/'
i2l5p8y,2022-03-29 10:10:58,cantrecall,tr2lhw,Is it dumb to get a niche zero to primarily use for filter coffee (hario switch)?,Yes I grind directly into the metal cup then I empty into a (Technivorm) basket with a pre-rinsed filter.  I use the metal cup like a measuring device and fill to the line for the 60-65 grams/1.25L water. I dont have a lot of static but I live in a high humidity area.  The included brush does a quick job of the remainders and its a part of the espresso routine.  Id totally buy a bigger cup if one were available. If you didnt have a Capresso Infinity and needed another grinder today which one is at the top of your list?,i2ktv8e,/r/Coffee/comments/tr2lhw/is_it_dumb_to_get_a_niche_zero_to_primarily_use/i2l5p8y/'

i2l99ar,2022-03-29 10:33:20,arnoldpettybunk,tr2lhw,Is it dumb to get a niche zero to primarily use for filter coffee (hario switch)?,That is a good question that I wish I had an answer to. I was initially drawn to the Fellow Ode because of its small size (dont have a ton of counter space) and single dose grinding. But there are a couple reviews / posts of people complaining about how it doesnt go fine enough for the Technivorm so that has me hesitating. If Costco still sold the Ode Id buy it and try it out but Im hesitant to buy directly from Ode without a good return policy. I also looked at the Vario W+ which seems like overkill but I do like the grind by weight feature.

So theres myriad numerous idiot businesses declaring their new technology to be the fourth wave!!! or making it out like theyre revolutionizing coffee brewing for bringing attention to detail to a percolator or whatever.  Sure theyre dumb as rocks and almost no one falls for it but it does indirectly build the notion that the next wave is imminent just around the corner and sufficiently easily prompted as one minor new tech change.    This is compounded by consumer and industry folks who really just want to level up and they feel like Third Wave is all played out or theyre bored of it now.  Theres too many new people too many people who arent like us or whatever other nonsense comes along - they liked Third Wave when it was small and exclusive and now that its not theyre wanting a new number they can look down from.   Theres just *so* much idiocy around Fourth Wave and whole deluges of self-importance so it irritates me almost a 100% of the time it comes up.    Bonus: but then what will the fourth wave be??? ...there may not be.  Wine is in its third wave and has been for a century or two while coffee has been in it for like thirty years - yet were the ones chomping at the bit to move on?  The dial may not go past three.  Wed need a new fundamental relationship between consumer and product equivalent in scale to people started going out for coffee - and so far were all out of gigantic changes like that especially that dont result in going backwards.,i2ksp15,/r/Coffee/comments/tr1v0y/mod_inside_scoop_ask_the_coffee_industry/i2l082x/'

We try to keep the complexity of the filtration simple enough that is easy enough to replicate at home especially for customers in our immediate geographic area (a simple Brita filter or similar does the job with Philly tap water) but we are only able to do this because of the composition of the tap water itself. If we had crazy hard water wed do RO or if we had unbelievably soft water wed be adding minerals.  If you cup/brew with unfiltered Philly tap water you lose almost all of the acidity in the coffee and everything tastes pretty savory/herbaceous or more bitter/chocolatey than it does with water that is more in line with what is generally regarded as good water for coffee brewing.,i2p00f8,/r/Coffee/comments/tr1v0y/mod_inside_scoop_ask_the_coffee_industry/i2r64m6/'

If they say yes they get the medium roast batch brew (classic chocolate notes). Of course if they ask for the medium roast with no room or the light roast with room we give them whatever they want.

Coffee houses in Germany London etc. become popular social spots.  Coffee served at Enlightenment salons.  18th-19th century speaking very roughly.  2nd Wave: Introduction of better storage and transport of coffee and increase in home brewing.  Cheap coffee in grocery stores and diners/delis.  Late 19th-late 20th century.    3rd Wave: Italian coffee and the idea of coffee shops become widespread across USA.  Fancy espresso drinks with lots of add-ons. Not sure what this looked like in Europe but Im sure it was not quite the same for obvious reasons.  4th Wave: Wider appreciation of lighter roasts single-origin microlots coffee processing techniques.  Couples with explosion of innovative home-brewing methods and wider appreciation of existing Hario Chemex equipment.  This is my own view and differs from popular definitions.

And that threshold is a lot higher than what most people want it to be (Id guess $250ish all-in for something like a 1zpresso JX cheap digital scale cheap kettle and a cheap French Press). Which is why there are so many gimmicky cheap crappy products on the market.  It would be like wanting to buy a good new car for less than $2000. Its just...not possible.

i2l7wda,2022-03-29 10:24:47,Anomander,tr1v0y,[MOD] Inside Scoop - Ask the coffee industry,The issue there is that waves already or at least previously had *shared meaning* that made them valuable discursive tools.    They lose that value as that shared meaning diminishes.  My issue is not that we dont have some proposed wave based model that accommodates desire-based labelling but that peoples desire to make a preexisting system fit their preconceptions makes the whole thing less *useful* as a way of discussing consumer culture.    So youre using the wave label here for something thats fundamentally completely different from how theyre presently defined and in a way that changes the focus of the model away from the consumer culture and over to industry practices - but also in a way that codifies current industry trends as practices fundamental to the current wave.  This frames waves out as exactly what the viewpoint I clash with wants them to be - simple trite modelling that phrases what we do as the best thing in a hierarchical progression frames what we used to do as clearly worse and outdated and leaves space for adding a new number when the Next Big Hotness shows up and everyone bandwagons it.

Third Wave is having a better understanding in coffee especially within the value chain better coffee quality than second wave and more relationship between the consumer and the barista. Fourth Wave is still debatable. Some say its leaning towards technology and automation.

You dont think that maybe a better way to discuss it would have been straightforward and honest rather than what happened here - straight thread hijack of what I said putting words in my mouth and going out of your way to miss my point in order to ignore feedback and re-imagine my opinions on the fly.  So yeah if you want to get treated like youre here for a discussion - actually act like thats the case.    You need to follow what the other person is saying not just imagine they said whatever is most convenient for you.  You spent four comments believing you had a nice cute additive point to a post that agreed with you and *now* after someone had to forcefully point out you were wrong - youre complaining about wanting discussion?

I was attempting to agree with your post and then have an interesting side-conversation.  Im sorry you felt I was trying to hijack your thread.  Im really not one who cares about things like karma and whatnot.  Let me sum up my points and be done:  * I too am annoyed by arbitrary marketing that employs talk of the 4th wave without understanding the motivation for a three-wave model.  This is why I responded to you.    * In addition I actually think three waves is also lacking in that it ignores the first consumer/industry phase when coffee consumption initially became widespread across Europe.  Thats all I was trying to say.  As an aside: Im still not sure if you consider the three wave model trite or if you agree with it... or perhaps a bit of both.  Im genuinely interested in talking about the history of coffee.    Anyway have a good one.,i2ne6kw,/r/Coffee/comments/tr1v0y/mod_inside_scoop_ask_the_coffee_industry/i2nnja3/'

We typically dont put them on hot drinks unless we have no stoppers (my location specifically hasnt had stoppers for a couple weeks now). According to standard arent supposed to because they are only intended for cold drinks on delivery orders. But if someone asks for a stopper and is insistent this is what would likely be given.

And the thinner the steel is as it has to be in a smaller moka pot the more problems you’re going to have with induction.   If you want to guarantee your stainless pot works on induction get a cheap cast iron skillet from a thrift shop.

Personally unless youre planning on using it to make a really small cup of latte Id get a bigger size the 4 cup version has a bigger base so it works with induction cookers just fine.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tqx8py/is_bialetti_venus_2_cup_stainless_steel/i2kjssy/'

No curdling observed with the bag of Brazilian coffee I have alongside.  In a completely unscientific test I added a pinch of baking soda to the filter and proceeded to make the pourover.

i2l183o,2022-03-29 09:42:46,mastley3,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I replaced a Bonavita Brewer with a Breville Precision Brewer hoping for more flexibility and control. My wife and I love coffee but both have trouble sleeping if we drink too much so I am on a strict caffeine regimen which means we are only brewing 34g/510ml which falls into the Single cup range.   I really wish I could drink more but I cant.   Anyway the coffee comes out luke warm often watery and under extracted. When I run water through it comes into the carafe at lke 151F. If I measure in the cone during brewing it tops out at 178F. This is with it set to 208F the maximum temp. If I do large batches it gets considerably hotter and it also is hotter if I preheat by running water through and then brewing the coffee.   Neither of those things is really our use case though. I am not really willing to make a large batch and throw out half the coffee or double the time to make coffee by running water through first (that also makes using the timer impossible).   So does anybody have success with single cup mode? Breville is sending me descaler but they dont think there is anything wrong with the machine. I say single cup mode should be able to brew good coffee and when I program it at 208F the water should get pretty close to that temperature at some point. All of which is pointing to me returning this machine. Any ideas?,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tqwbuq/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2l183o/'

i2l7u8t,2022-03-29 10:24:24,ChOpSu3y,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I bought my parents this machine to upgrade from their Mr. Coffee basic setup as a way to try and find a middle ground that wouldnt interrupt their normal pre-ground easy morning routine but would deliver an improvement while allowing for some more experimentation as a treat when I visit. I was expressing my frustrations with the machine the other morning when I was visiting i.e. the dripper creates a well in the bed low temp bloom water. My dad stopped me and told me that the coffee they are making with the machine is a considerable improvement to what they had before and that they love it.  I think that middle ground is the target Breville is looking to fill and leaves something to be desired by enthusiasts.  My intuition is that the water lines within the machine and the process for heating will always require some amount of pre-warming or flushing to deliver advertised temperatures at the start of the brew which is what I have started doing (add 200 ml additional water and run that into the cone stop the brew and discard the water then add coffer to pre-warmed cone and start brew).  I do not have any personal experience but I have read that the Technivorm Moccamaster is superior as a pure brewer in turns of temps and other factors but offers little to none in terms of additional features.  If you are brewing a single 500ml batch one might consider a manual method like the v60?  Good luck!,i2l183o,/r/Coffee/comments/tqwbuq/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2l7u8t/'

If you cant tell if it is good or bad or if it gets better or worse when you adjust the grind then you need to experiment with extremely fine and extremely coarse grinds to get more experience with what the incorrect grind sizes taste like. Eventually youll be able to just dial it in yourself. Theres never really a good way to answer this question because everyone always just wants a number to use but it depends so hugely on the specific coffee you are using as well as some other factors that there just isnt a number we can give you.

I’d get the white porcelain one. I recommend getting the larger 185 model so you have room to brew more than 1 cup.   If you’re not dead set on the Kalita I really like using my Blue Bottle dripper. It’s essentially a porcelain single hole Kalita Wave 185 that can use the same 185 filters.,i2jyh2g,/r/Coffee/comments/tqwbuq/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2l9i2e/'

If you drink 1-2 pour over or french press a day i think you will be happy with a metal burr handgrinder.

I want to use drawdown as well but there are so many other variables that seem to change total brew time across different beans that it seems less reliable than taste.

i2l0xc3,2022-03-29 09:40:54,icantfindfree,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Imo the taste difference is pretty huge but thats subjective. What isnt subjective is how much less effort a good hand grinder takes. I can do 21g in just under 35 secs with my JX pro and it isnt hard at all on the other hand my old Skelton would take almost 5 minutes for the same amount of very light roast with what felt like actual physical effort. This alone is worth the upgrade imo,i2kwfjd,/r/Coffee/comments/tqwbuq/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2l0xc3/'
i2l05i2,2022-03-29 09:36:05,mailto_devnull,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,The general consensus here seems to be that upgrading grinders will always give you the best bang for your buck.  The greatest improvement comes from when you upgrade from no grinder at all (preground from supermarket) but the incremental steps afterward I hear are also worth it.

i2q11ur,2022-03-30 08:03:06,VibrantCoffee,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Yeah drawdown time varies a lot bean to bean so it is not a good way to dial in.  Have you tried cupping with a pretty fine grind or the Hoffmann FP method (basically cupping)? That will give you an idea of what flavors each coffee has to offer. That combined with purposely massively underextracted and massively overextracted pourovers should start to give you a better idea of what issues you are tasting in your normal brews and you can start working the pourovers towards how the cuppings taste.,i2pz9k1,/r/Coffee/comments/tqwbuq/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2q11ur/'

i2tafqp,2022-03-30 22:23:34,sqwtrp,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,stir it right up front then let it settle the crust should usually still form.  then let it sit for your brew time (e.g. 3 mins) then release. not a lot of utility in breaking the crust imho since the point of that with french press or whatever is letting the grounds settle to the bottom.,i2t15qo,/r/Coffee/comments/tqwbuq/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2tafqp/'

i2mbnaw,2022-03-29 14:34:42,mailto_devnull,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Im not one to go against JH but as a French Press is an immersion brew the crust itself does not contribute for or against the extraction of the coffee itself its the coffee grounds in contact with the water.  Extraction typically stops in a French press due to the lowering of the temperature of water over time. Thats why typical French Press recipes talk about 4 minutes and James Hoffman can double that and still come up with a good cup of coffee.,i2m0td8,/r/Coffee/comments/tqwbuq/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2mbnaw/'

i2n1oxt,2022-03-29 16:02:32,zFreeZeD,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,My current challenge is that the Ottomatic adds in water to the point it sinks the coffee below it instead of making the coffee grow with it. Left picture shows how I believe is supposed to be with grind expanding as water drops. In my case water drops and ends up adding a 2-3mm later of water on top of the grind coffee which I believe makes it pointless for the ottomatic to distribute water since the drops fall to the water as it’s above the coffee grind.

i2q0orc,2022-03-30 08:00:39,VibrantCoffee,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Hm I am glad you figured it out but that seems weird that this was only happening with the Ottomatic and not when you were pouring yourself with a kettle.

i330j1s,2022-04-02 00:16:47,zFreeZeD,tqwbuq,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I think that the difference would be mainly the speed of pouring. The ottomatic comes with the plastic clip and I’m sure that’s the reason while buying the chemex alone doesn’t bring it. I can pour the water slowly and do it in 2-3 batches while ottomatic is constantly throwing water even if a slow pace. So far it’s been great now!,i2q0orc,/r/Coffee/comments/tqwbuq/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i330j1s/'

If instead you think that its not exactly watery but just doesnt taste as good as you increasing your dose it could be because you prefer some part of what the bean can offer but not all.

You could try a higher agitation method (just use 3 pours letting the water lower to almost the grounds bed before proceeding with the following pour) and see if that gives you that extra body youd be looking for.

i2jix9x,2022-03-29 01:47:18,UniqueLoginID,tquce9,Flat Burr vs Conical Burr Grinder,The dry puckering experience you describe is astringency. That would need a coarser grind.   Not being able to get the flavours you want would suggest you need to improve extraction.  Which your grinder won’t help you with.   I personally am not a fan of sharing grind settings as conditions vary learn to dial in.   That said the comandante is probably the best for recipe sharing.   A comandante you could also take to work and use at home for consistency - something lacking in your brews.   I’d be learning towards a comandante c40 mk iv or an electric grinder with 64mm SSP brew burrs (I love mine).   Look up the barista hustle compass.

i2odrmz,2022-03-29 21:32:44,ohgodnotmyselfesteem,tquce9,Flat Burr vs Conical Burr Grinder,Before changing your grinder I would first try to work out if it is just an issue of extraction. I find it very very helpful to brew multiple cups of the same coffee and taste them side by side when Im trying to judge the extraction. Dont be afraid of wasting coffee its cheaper than replacing your grinder and try to wait for them to all cool to a warm temp before trying them the hotter temperature makes coffee taste more bitter and harder to notice flavours  (in my experience).  And finally as a shot in the dark try brewing with a French press/aero press if it still doesnt work out. Immersion brews generally tastes better than the v60 when its not [when its not perfectly dialled in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09fNvoQMlGw) and are generally not as impacted by technique if it is your technique that is causing the problem.

Also I own the uniform and I wouldnt really upgrade unless you are really going to *upgrade*. Having used a variety of grinders in a commercial setting I dont think there is anything that competes with it in terms of grind consistency unless you are ready to spend at least double as much. The df64 with SSP will be a tiny bit better but imo it isnt worth that. Its only until you start getting to the p64 type range that there is an improvement that I considered worth it.

i2myh2o,2022-03-29 15:57:50,North_Dog_5748,tquce9,Flat Burr vs Conical Burr Grinder,Just to clarify the Fellow Shimmy Coffee Sieve removes most of the particles that are *less than 200 microns* (what might be considered the fines) leaving you with the coarser grounds but the actual target size for most pourovers would usually be considerably coarser than this (200 microns is around low espresso grind territory).   The issue does sound like astringency to me. If the other flavours are decent as you describe but the dry sensation overshadows the good flavours and detracts from what would otherwise be good levels of sweetness and acidity/juiciness its possible that some small changes to technique rather than significant changes to grind setting could fix the issue.   Like things to promote as much evenness to the extraction as possible like even saturation during the bloom Rao spins experimenting with pouring methods/patterns etc. Or perhaps play with water temperature as well.   Just guessing tho could be wrong.   Hope you manage to get on top of it.,i2kpeaj,/r/Coffee/comments/tquce9/flat_burr_vs_conical_burr_grinder/i2myh2o/'
i37a7n4,2022-04-03 01:30:35,Alone-Long-8728,tquce9,Flat Burr vs Conical Burr Grinder,Ah yes so I’ve been having a similar problem with “dryness” in the cup. same beans same grinder different filter… the ones with the tab are Dutch made filters. The 40 packs (which I bought on its own because my kasuya ceramic v60 didn’t come with any) gave me wayyyyy more sweetness in the cup. When I found out about the 100 packs I thought it made more economical sense to buy those but yea since then I’ve had troubles extracting the sweeter more tea-like subtle notes.   I would try swapping out your filters before feeling the need to replace your grinder.  I also tried various recipes kasuya Hoffman rao etc… they are all good recipes but I’m too lazy to do all that mess 2X a day haha! What I took away though is a bigger bloom helps and the more ground coffee you use the repeatability gets easier.  In short:  1) try the Japanese filters first 2) increase your bloom (2X or more) 3) increase dose (20-22g),i378zv4,/r/Coffee/comments/tquce9/flat_burr_vs_conical_burr_grinder/i37a7n4/'

i2qird8,2022-03-30 10:01:00,North_Dog_5748,tquce9,Flat Burr vs Conical Burr Grinder,Yes I would agree fines would normally be considered more like sub 50um or sub 100um that sort of range.    My comment was in response to the comment made by a previous responder a couple of comments before which to me seemed to read that they were saying the grind size for most pourovers is around 200 microns which is presumably not what they actually meant because that is of course a very fine grind size.    It was them who first mentioned the Fellow sieve that I referred to.    I said what might be considered the fines just for simplicity as that seems to be the purpose generally speaking of the sieve they mentioned. But my main point was more about just clearing up any possible confusion about pourover grind size when referring to microns.    But I can see how my comment might have read without taking into account the context of that previous comment. I probably should have made it more clear.    Chinese whispers perhaps! 🤣   Yes testing burr alignment then looking at all other possibilities some of which have been discussed is probably a good way for op to go.,i2odt39,/r/Coffee/comments/tquce9/flat_burr_vs_conical_burr_grinder/i2qird8/'

Ive seen the James Hoffman video but the differences are not as subtle. The tabbed filter stalls out.  I bought a case of the untabbed.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tqtt15/these_v60_filters_are_not_the_same_anybody_here/i2k66o7/'
i2jb4co,2022-03-28 23:53:36,FrenkyV,tqtt15,These v60 filters are not the same. Anybody here have similar experience? More in comments,The left box is the one I usually buy and come in 40. The right one comes in a plastic cover and has 100.  The right one feels thicker and more ‘papery’ where the left one is more soft.   It takes significantly longer to brew coffee with the right one when I use the same beans and same grinding.  The right one also has an extra lip and the letter v60 in them.  Oh and I just realized the right one is made in Holland and the left in Japan. So the right might be fake?,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tqtt15/these_v60_filters_are_not_the_same_anybody_here/i2jb4co/'

Depending on what youre using for making cold brew youll find that once the brew is finished steeping and the grounds need to be removed from the beverage either the brew is going to be muddy because the coarser cold brew filter cant filter the finer moka pot grind particles out or that itll take foreeeeeeeeever to filter out the grounds because theyre so fine.

i2ihzu6,2022-03-28 18:56:46,sprobeforebros,tqouod,[Question]About cold brewing,1: dont alter your brew ratio.  Youre not going to see substantially more extraction out of a finer grind with a cold brew application.  If you brew with a weaker brew ratio youre just going to end up with cold brew thats both sludgy *and* weak.   &#x200B  2: the problem youre going to run into using finer ground coffee isnt that itll over extract or be overly strong what youll run into is that once the brew is finished you cant physically separate the grounds from the drink.  If youre using something like a toddy maker youll find that itll take like 2 hours for it to fully finish dripping through the felt filter rather than the 10 minutes youre used to. If youre using something that uses a metal filter youll end up with sediment coming through and might want to clarify it further by filtering once the standard way and then pouring that resulting beverage through a paper coffee filter.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tqouod/questionabout_cold_brewing/i2ihzu6/'

I still used it in my French press but I used a couple paper filters because if I didnt Id get lots of grounds in my coffee and it was not a fun experience.  Have you used espresso alone before? It may be VERY bitter using it alone in bigger batches in cold brew. But all you can do is experiment with your method and see if you like it.

i2il52t,2022-03-28 19:21:58,Bibingka_Malagkit,tqouod,[Question]About cold brewing,>I am not an expert but I was once gifted pre-ground coffee which is equally fine to espresso. I still used it in my French press but I used a couple paper filters because if I didnt Id get lots of grounds in my coffee and it was not a fun experience.  Ive always bought my coffee pre-ground as I dont have a grinder. Appliances/gadgets related to coffee are expensive here and my wife thinks that investing on something that you can get out of a sachet is not worth the money. I know. Sad. :(  I had a French press though and I didnt mind the texture.  >Have you used espresso alone before? It may be VERY bitter using it alone in bigger batches in cold brew.  Ive only used espresso grounds for drip coffee maker but other than that never for cold brew. I dont mind bitterness as I actually like bitter coffee. Ill see what I get out of this and I hope Itll be at least good.  Thanks!,i2ii7te,/r/Coffee/comments/tqouod/questionabout_cold_brewing/i2il52t/'

i2h2ksq,2022-03-28 12:19:03,wipny,tqg6rh,What receptacle for Aeropress sometimes + Kalita wave other times?,I really do not recommend plunging an AeroPress directly on a glass server.   I’ve seen videos of people doing it but all it takes is either slipping or using too much weight for there to be a very nasty accident.   For the Kalita Wave I think this [Kinto 600ml glass server](https://kinto-usa.com/products/27592) should work?   I use the glass Torch Pitchii server for my Blue Bottle dripper which is pretty similar in size and shape to the Kalita Wave 185.

Storing beans in an air tight or vacuum (vacuumed are better) container is super important … also grinding beans fresh …. Rather than pre-grinding your beans helps slow oxidation.  So get a bean container and find your beans fresh and they’ll last a little longer than a week.   Best container imo the Fellow Atmos.

The speed it heats up water  alone makes electric ones worth it. But the goose neck programmable temp and portability of it (outlet vs needing stove/hot plate) make it even more so. I’ve had mine a couple years now and still going strong no complaints. As far as your all-encompassing request if I’m not doing pour overs I just remove the lid and dump it straight from the top.

i2gos7q,2022-03-28 10:43:17,SheldonvilleRoasters,tq8qy2,What makes a grinder great?,With Mahlkonigs its about durability and consistency.  They need to be able to be turned on and off a gajillion times per day as well as grind coffee without the machine overheating (like REALLY fast grinding) and re-roasting the coffee with minimum slop regarding grind consistency.   To do that they need beefy metal for heat sinking solid and durable electronics (not just Radio Shack hobby quality) and fine quality burrs.    If you compare an EK43 with something like a Vario-W youll find that the Vario will overheat and will bog down if grinding much more than 40 grams of coffee at a time.  The EK43 can grind a lot of coffee very quickly without overheating.     I have an older Guatemala shop grinder and it is blisteringly fast in grinding and can also grind fine enough to make a somewhat acceptable (non-gag inducing) espresso shot.    The burrs are expensive because they need to withstand lots of grinding in a shop setting.  If I remember they used to have a program where you would send in your burrs and theyd send back re-sharpened ones in return so you didnt have to pay full price for a new set.  Im not sure if they still do that anymore.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tq8qy2/what_makes_a_grinder_great/i2gos7q/'

And by chance the cutting profile of the burrs were discovered to be very nice for espresso by an Australian shop. The EK43 was planned to be discontinued until it gained popularity again.  One of the biggest costs is probably the motor. For a 83 mm burr you need quite a bit of torque. And since it needs to operate daily in many consequetive runs the motor needs to be good.    And then you need a good construction to hold everything in place. This is also expensive to make.

i2g85gl,2022-03-28 08:52:13,TheMauveHand,tq8qy2,What makes a grinder great?,IMO its mostly the box it all comes in and healthy margins. Mechanically a coffee grinder (sans burrs) is about as complex as an electric drill: its got a simple motor a couple of gears perhaps a very finely cut bolt with lockers for adjustment a couple of bearings and some simple chutes and stuff for putting coffee in and getting it out. Thats it. A lot of people here are pointing at the motor but an HG-2 doesnt even *have* one and it still costs $1500 dollars. It has literally the same exact parts made larger of course larger as any 1ZPresso hand grinder plus some gears.   But then you have the chassis. Machined aluminium anodized or powder coated tight tolerances and most importantly low volume manufacturing with few standard pieces and all in a place where manufacturing is expensive.  The mechanicals properly produced in volume shouldnt cost a lot. You can buy an entire ***new car*** for the price of say an EG-1 and still have enough left over to buy an HG-1. Sure its a cheap POS car but its got a hell of a lot more precision machining and moving parts and motors and pumps and all that gubbins in it and all of that has to put up with a hell of a lot more punishment than some roasted beans will provide.

Something like an EK43 is built like an absolute tank and has a burr set that can grind over 7 tons of coffee (according to Mahlkonig) before needing replacement. Its a grinder meant to do a bag at a time that just also happens to be good at espresso (if aligned correctly which unfortunately is not a given).   Something like a Kafatek Monolith Flat Max or an Option-O Lagom P100 require very high precision machining (Option-O have a spec of 10µm for all parts and 5µm for flatness Kafatek is similar).  Then theres the burrs.

Problem with increasing the production is that its very hard while keeping quality the same. That’s one of the reasons I decided to go all in and machine all my own parts. As soon as I started ordering larger quantities from local machine shops there were always problems. I put tolerance of 5 or 10 microns on print and they are asking me why do you need that for coffee grinder!???  > Latest example was when I started making burrs. I really really did not want to surface grind the blanks for burrs to make them flat and parallel. Reason being its another expensive machine I have to buy another process I have to learn another machine to maintain and space to hold it. I took blanks to local shops that have “Precision” in the name and all they do is surface grinding and asked to grind blanks to 2 microns or less in flatness and parallelism. They told me same thing I’ve heard before why do you need it that good and then I don’t think we can do it in production. They did samples and 70% of them were around 10 microns. You can guess how this story ended  > So for me its very slow to grow and keep everything at the level I want it. And interest in growth for me is driven by desire to expand capabilities of what I can do in the shop.

If you build cheap and fast you have to accept a degree of misalignment or inconsistency.  In really bad cases this means your machine eats bearings or has huge/uneven gaps.  If you want to eliminate that increasing precision starts to go up by orders of magnitude as it eventually changes the entire process one can use to build the machines.,i2fy48m,/r/Coffee/comments/tq8qy2/what_makes_a_grinder_great/i2j4d2r/'

i2gyfiy,2022-03-28 11:50:22,TheMauveHand,tq8qy2,What makes a grinder great?,I mean you could maybe describe one half of a lathe as a drill sure but thats just the spinning. The cutting is what makes a lathe a lathe.  Honestly that was a really obviously poor analogy.  But I wonder what sort of lathe could you buy with EG-1 money? And how does that lathe then compare to the grinder in mechanical capability?  Come to think of it pop some burrs in a lathe and youve got a grinder sans the feed mechanism. So a drill is half a lathe but a lathe is exactly the same as a grinder.,i2gx0lc,/r/Coffee/comments/tq8qy2/what_makes_a_grinder_great/i2gyfiy/'

i2jtu9h,2022-03-29 04:16:01,Hour-Neighborhood311,tq8qy2,What makes a grinder great?,A long time ago I worked in a sheet metal shop. The cost in labor to set up a machine to for example punch holes in a chassis while the metal is still flat is high but the cost of setup per part is determined by how many parts made before tearing the setup down. That piece of metal would need to be bent in various ways and ultimately painted. This requires multiple setups each requiring expensive labor before actually doing anything to the parts. The cost of setup labor utterly dominated the cost of small production runs. Ford sold 1929195 vehicles in 2020 ([https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2020-us-vehicle-sales-figures-by-brand/](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2020-us-vehicle-sales-figures-by-brand/)).

The OP is asking what makes a grinder so expensive if the burrs *which do the cutting* are relatively so cheap. Remove the burrs and a grinder is little more than a drill in a weird housing: an electric motor a threaded shaft a couple of bearings a spring. Sometimes some gears. Or if you insist add the burrs then its a lathe with a really weird cutter the point remains the same: for $4200 you can buy yourself a lathe thatll be a hell of a lot more capable than an EG-1 is despite doing the same mechanical action with broadly the same components.,i2gzxwr,/r/Coffee/comments/tq8qy2/what_makes_a_grinder_great/i2h1guh/'
i2h36ce,2022-03-28 12:23:15,ReallySmallWeenus,tq8qy2,What makes a grinder great?,Ok. Let’s keep the lathe comparison going because you seem to agree that a lathe is very similar to a coffee grinder in its ability to hold things and rotate them in a precise way. If you remove the burrs (cutting tool) from the burr  mechanism (tool holder) you have not reduced the grinder (lathe) to the complexity of a simple electric drill.,i2h1guh,/r/Coffee/comments/tq8qy2/what_makes_a_grinder_great/i2h36ce/'
i2h5iel,2022-03-28 12:39:19,TheMauveHand,tq8qy2,What makes a grinder great?,>If you remove the burrs (cutting tool) from the burr mechanism (tool holder) you have not reduced the grinder (lathe) to the complexity of a simple electric drill.  I think you absolutely have *mechanically*. Theyre electric motors turning a single shaft which is threaded. The rest is just a housing for it and minor irrelevant accessories. The core mechanicals the thing that is complex is the same.  The point is to illustrate that youre not paying for a lot of *mechanical* technology complexity or innovation. Youre paying for appearance youre paying for fit and finish youre paying for low-volume manufacturing usually in expensive locations and a fat margin. You can look at grinders from the 1920s and they look exactly like the EK43 mentioned above and have the same components.  A different way of looking at it is to think what would be the earliest point in history we humanity had the mechanical technology necessary to manufacture a functionally equivalent object. In the case of an electric coffee grinder Id argue that point in time is around 1900 ***if*** we make it out of steel and wood instead of aluminium and plastic including the burrs. Yes its quite complex high-tech machining at that point in time but absolutely doable. So given that we are looking at late 19th century engineering surely thats not the bit of the machinery that costs upwards of $2000 to produce a century and change later right? It has to be something else.,i2h36ce,/r/Coffee/comments/tq8qy2/what_makes_a_grinder_great/i2h5iel/'

Are there possibly any general rules-of-thumb that I need to know about the 6 that I wasnt having to deal with on the 3?  No matter what I seem to do I am getting REALLY stiff coffee.  I use a fellow ode and my last batch I did at 4.1 ( with 205\* water 50g coffee \~800ml water ) ... even at 4.1 it wouldnt really drain.  I tried holding the filter up over the chemex and it drained much faster that way but still ended up with significantly too-strong of coffee ( plus that is prone to burning :-p )  This bean specifically is a medium roast pretty dry-looking beans... should that be relevant.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tq5unx/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2g5r3w/'

(will change to grams this morning)  4) hand burr grind medium size slightly fruity roasted 5 days ago beans  5) chlorine off gassed water (will upgrade to distilled and add salts to improve it later) 6) pour over through a biodegradable filter straight into a thermos flask to keep it warm. 7) mix the coco in 7.1) testing: maybe put teaspoon of butter in or coco butter 8) pour the frothed milk on top   At the moment I think the coco is overpowering the coffee.   Chocolate can be as pompous as coffee so it seems ripe for balancing the 2. Theres grades of beans and everything. Ive recently changed from a more bitter coco powder.

i2huert,2022-03-28 15:40:52,droffit,tq5unx,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Generally I use α 1:16 ratio but experimented with 1:14-1:17 which didn’t help. I’ve tried several different pouring techniques I use α gooseneck. I’ve gone slow medium fast etc. Concentric circles. Usually pour 60% then 40%. But have tried smaller increments pouring 80g at α time for example. I have pretty good water here in Canada and used to use α Brita as well. I thought water was perhaps still the issue so I only use Third Wave Water now. I generally only brew light roasts (seems like what is usually the only option at the roasters in my city). I’ve probably tried at least 15-20 different types of coffee and still get the same results. Ethiopians are my go-to though.,i2hrgjd,/r/Coffee/comments/tq5unx/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2huert/'

i2g4g3h,2022-03-28 08:27:16,nerdyjorj,tq5unx,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Although its not ideal you can get away with a volumetric approach with an aeropress since its really not that fussy. Same with grind size - although slightly coarser than espresso is ideal it doesnt care that much compared to most methods.  Heres a rough method that should get you a tasty cup of long coffee:  1. Put paper in plastic top. Make wet. Screw into aeropress.  2. Boil kettle then open the lid to allow it to cool down a bit. I use 80C water but other people use hotter and are quite happy with the results. Generally colder water = less bitter.  3. Put a splash of hot water in the mug then stick the plunger in to warm up a bit. Where you might be brewing a little colder if you go down to 80 this is particularly important to get some heat in your vessel of choice.  4. Remove plunger. Throw away water. Put aeropress on top of mug.  5. Put a generous tablespoon of coffee into the aeropress (20g if you have a scale). Coffee is close enough to flour that you can [use the same volumetric conversions in a pinch](https://www.yuppiechef.com/spatula/the-truth-about-spoons/).  5. Put a splash of hot water on the coffee and make a paste. Leave it for between 1 and 3 minutes depending on how much of a rush youre in. If youre new to coffee this is called a bloom and is pretty common in fancypants methods.  6. Gently pour water into the aeropress up to the 3 line. Stir fairly vigorously. Top up to the brim. Wait another 2-5 mins.  7. put the plunger in the top and push down slowly with an even pressure until it starts to fart at you.  8. Remove aeropress (opt - flick any excess liquid into the sink like a samurai cleaning blood from their sword).  9. Add whatever you normally do to coffee.  10. Enjoy.,i2g1ose,/r/Coffee/comments/tq5unx/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2g4g3h/'

i2i4zs1,2022-03-28 17:11:09,MikeTheBlueCow,tq5unx,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,As long as you dont remove the bottom burr you shouldnt need to realign. Also make sure when you remove the top burr that you replace it in the same orientation (there are three pegs you might want to mark one peg and the slot it inserts into so you always know the right way to put it). This should keep the alignment the same.  I went to the plumbing aisle and got the tiniest o-rings they had. Its an okay fit. You can go to the hardware aisle and get stainless steel washers for a #6 size screw and those work too but will have to be placed behind the spout piece where the silicone declumper was.

i2g00b8,2022-03-28 07:56:22,kylekoi55,tq33je,[EUROPE] Single Origin Vietnamese Coffee,Unadulterated coffee is  very uncommon in Vietnam even when you order a black coffee or cà phê đen it usually comes premixed with sugar (especially if iced) or if not most everyone will at least add sugar. If you want a black coffee in Vietnam you must specify black coffee with no sugar or cà phê đen không đường. I know it sounds redundant but it reinforces the cultural norm with regards to how coffee is taken. The Vietnamese see coffee as a bitter (but aromatic) ingredient to be manipulated with other ingredients to strike a balance (same philosophy as in Vietnamese cooking). Arabica on its own to the Vietnamese palate is sour and when used as a stand in for robusta is too weak (lacking the body and caffeine).,i2f2xkc,/r/Coffee/comments/tq33je/europe_single_origin_vietnamese_coffee/i2g00b8/'

The city exists pretty much for food/farming and for domestic tourism its the premiere honeymoon destination in Viet Nam. Foreign tourists definitely go there (or they did pre-covid) but not as many as go to other places like Phu Quoc or Nha Trang or Hoi An.

i2eb7a1,2022-03-27 20:48:46,APile-ofRocks,tq0act,Nespresso Machine,Nespresso was my first foray into drinking non-drip coffee and it was the first time I enjoyed black coffee too.  Although I enjoyed it at the time I would not recommend plopping down the multiple hundreds of dollars they want for a nespresso machine. You can get one of the cheaper models that does just the coffee those arent too expensive.  Personally Id recommend getting a starter espresso machine like a Gaggia Classic or even a Breville Infuser. They require more work but you can start with preground coffee on these as well.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tq0act/nespresso_machine/i2eb7a1/'

i2df5y9,2022-03-27 16:23:26,magnetic_yeti,tpvagr,ISO 240v high amp/wattage (fast) gooseneck kettle for pourovers.,Do you have a 240v outlet you can use?  If not you need an electrician to install that first. Trying to use a 240v kettle with a 120v outlet (or vice versa) will lead to an all around bad time. It’s possible you could use a step-up converter (takes two 110v plugs and steps up to a single 220v plug) but I’d want that to be extremely high quality at which point it might just be cheaper to have an electrician do what needs to be done.   Once you do have it your options are basically “smuggling” one in from a 240v country or getting from some commercial supplier or a supplier that sells for non-domestic use.  One common alternative: if you have a 220v range then your range is capable of delivering the same wattage as a kettle. If it’s an induction range then you can use an induction compatible kettle to get the same fast boiling as a stand-alone 220v kettle. If you have a gas range you can likely get faster-than-110v but slower-than-220v boil times with an oven kettle but you’ll also lose some extra energy in that process.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpvagr/iso_240v_high_ampwattage_fast_gooseneck_kettle/i2df5y9/'

i2d867g,2022-03-27 15:26:07,psykotedy,tpubk3,Long time drinker trying to get off sweets,What worked for me was decreasing the amount of sweetenerover time. You’re going to have to play with how much to cut out at a time as well as the amount of time you give yourself to adjust because that’s based on you palate. My approach was to cut it in half for a week or two then cut it in half again for another week or two and so on until the amount was ridiculous to even bother with. ymmv,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpubk3/long_time_drinker_trying_to_get_off_sweets/i2d867g/'

i2d8knl,2022-03-27 15:29:29,SJW_Censorship,tpubk3,Long time drinker trying to get off sweets,Just stop adding sugar and drink it for a few days and your brain will adapt to just the sweetness of the milk. Milk is plenty sweet enough.  I know you said you dont want to grind or whatever but...  Well espresso coffee can be made with a much higher milk to water ratio and because it extracts quicker you get more of the sweet coffee flavours and less of the bitter flavours. Overall I think a nicer way to drink coffee than brewed or drip coffee especially without sugar.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpubk3/long_time_drinker_trying_to_get_off_sweets/i2d8knl/'
i2gzlrz,2022-03-28 11:58:29,Iamindeedamexican,tpubk3,Long time drinker trying to get off sweets,I’m just echoing what others have said but definitely try some high quality beans ground fresh. My wife used to add coffee to her creamer essentially and now she drinks it black. We started out with speciality coffee beans roasted fresh but she’s used to it now so she can drink non-freshly roasted (but ground fresh) supermarket coffee black as well without any sugar or creamer.   I know you mentioned you don’t care to start certain things to improve your coffee but it’s a *real* slippery slope once you start seeing how coffee can really taste so here are my thoughts/steps:  -Most reward for least effort: I think the best thing you could do is buy freshly ground high quality beans from a local coffee shop (not dark roast so you can taste the actual coffee bean and not the roast) if that’s all the effort you can muster. This’ll be wildly more expensive than your Folgers so be prepared but give it a shot. Typical costs are $12-20 for a 12oz bag.   -The next step would be to grind fresh daily. Look for a cheap burr grinder. I know many (myself included) would say a cheap one can’t do a great job because of fines inconsistency etc. But this will still get you leaps and bounds ahead of where your at.   -After that get a better coffee maker. I’d imagine you’re using a pretty typical drip machine but those make pretty average coffee. If you wanna go cheap but more effort get something like a French press aeropress or a pourover coffee maker (many pros and cons of each). If you want less effort but have some cash burning a hole in your pocket invest in a quality brewer like a Moccamaster or a Breville Precision Brewer. They are expensive but will make vastly better coffee than the machine you have now and all at the push of a button.   All that being said I’ve tried to get my dad into coffee and recently he brewed me a batch of coffee that he brewed into a half pot of day-old coffee from the night before. Some people just don’t wanna bother. I think buying better beans anything is better than Folgers would be a start.  Feel free to ask any questions!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpubk3/long_time_drinker_trying_to_get_off_sweets/i2gzlrz/'
i2ddhw2,2022-03-27 16:10:24,dayflyer55,tpubk3,Long time drinker trying to get off sweets,Honestly just use better coffee.  Commodity grade coffee is always going to be extremely bitter.

i2f0cjj,2022-03-28 01:52:06,Notspherry,tpubk3,Long time drinker trying to get off sweets,What worked for me is those long suger bags. They allow you to easily dose 1/2 or 1/3 of a bag.  Is the sweetener you use actually better from a caloric perspective than sugar? US regulations are weird. They allow a ridiculously low serving size and then round down the numbers. Ive seen zero calorie sweetener that was 100% dextrose.    But onto your question: switch to a brewing method like v60 or aeropress and a medium to light roast. A coffee scale (accurate digital scale with a timer) is very nice to have and allows you to easily find out and repeat what works best for you. You can spend loads of money on these but my 30$ one works just fine.   At a later point you may decide to get a nice grinder but for pourover you dont need to start with one.  Using less coffee may actually result in a more bitter cup. There is an order in which the soluble bits of the coffee are released and the ones towards the end are more bitter. This is called overextraction. What you could try is brew a bit less coffee the amount of grounds you use and then dilute the coffee a bit with hot water afterwards.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpubk3/long_time_drinker_trying_to_get_off_sweets/i2f0cjj/'

Smaller bags or containers enough to consume within two weeks while they’re fresh enough to taste good.  And/or try flavored coffees.

Other folks have already said it but a slow taper down off the sugar will have better success in the long run.  Assuming you use white sugar give some other natural sweeteners a try if you can they can feel a little more full in the cup than white sugar for the same amount.

i2e3zf3,2022-03-27 19:45:16,uniquedifferences,tpubk3,Long time drinker trying to get off sweets,The reason this is a good answer is great coffee is nowhere as bitter as Folgers. This means less sweetness is needed. I was happily surprised when in the same position as OP.

i2g7gne,2022-03-28 08:47:38,PeaTearGriphon,tpubk3,Long time drinker trying to get off sweets,I did this used to get a double-double every morning. I switched to one sugar two-cream. It took about a month to get used to maybe a little more. I tried going from there to zero but it was too big a leap so I bought some honey and would just coat a teaspoon with a little and stir my coffee.   When I went to zero sweetness I found adding more cream helped. I went to 3 cream for awhile and never looked back on sugar.  I now drink it black after slowly reducing my cream. I found low amounts of cream tasted worse than black which was weird.  Unlike sugar I can go back to coffee with cream no problem. Once I had sugar free coffee for awhile I couldnt even drink coffee with sugar it tasted bad.,i2d867g,/r/Coffee/comments/tpubk3/long_time_drinker_trying_to_get_off_sweets/i2g7gne/'

You wont love everything but its fun and youll be surprised by how much variation there is.   2. If theres a cafe near you that serves coffee from a french press try it. If you like it Id strongly consider buying one.

i2c7161,2022-03-27 10:50:17,Trelin21,tpnea1,Is French press “worthy” of fancy expensive freshly roasted and ground beans?,Life and coffee follow one simple rule. Garbage in garbage out.  Now you can take something fancy and turn it to garbage but if you take something nice and treat it well - you will have a better result.  French press Aeropress pour over drip espresso moka cowboy perk... All different ways to brew a cup. All have different strengths. Some will accentuate profiles of the roast some will accentuate profiles of the bean.  ALL Will brew a cup of coffee. So ask yourself - do you want to make coffee with something nice?     Seriously though - a lot of coffees taste comes down to a few simple variables:     * Time * Temperature * Grind size and uniformity * Bean age * Bean roast * Bean preparation/harvet * Bean origin/soil/species  &#x200B  If you use good beans and manage your grind better than a blade grinder then time and temp are variables you can control in almost all brew methods.

i2ct76d,2022-03-27 13:28:01,gampsandtatters,tpnea1,Is French press “worthy” of fancy expensive freshly roasted and ground beans?,There are essentially 4 methods of brewing:  1) Pressure method - ex. Espresso and Moka Pot 2) Gravity method - ex. Drip and Pour Over 3) Immersion method - ex. French Press 4) Boiling method - Turkish and “Cowboy”  All will yield excellent coffee given that you follow solid parameters and use good product. All will also yield shit coffee if no care of parameters are observed and the product is subpar. There will also be cases where you can mix up good/bad parameters and good/shit product.   French Press is possibly the closest method that roasters use when they taste-test a process called cupping. It’s an immersion brew method. Now tell me why on earth French Press would be “just a cup of coffee” when it is in the same category of method as the standard method that roasters use to determine quality of product?   I would also add that equipment need not be fancy to produce a great cuppa. The only thing I advise on getting top notch results is getting a burr grinder vs a blade grinder.

i2cnk0s,2022-03-27 12:45:53,drdfrster64,tpnea1,Is French press “worthy” of fancy expensive freshly roasted and ground beans?,People don’t like French Presses because it diminishes clarity. Key word being *diminishes* not eliminates. Not only that but clarity is relative and it’s not the only thing people look for in coffee.   In return you get a consistent brewing method which is a huge thing here. A lot of people would rather have a brewing method that’s not as good in exchange for consistency. You’d rather have a consistently good cup then an inconsistent cup that’s usually meh and sometimes really good. It’s a big reason why the Kalita exist and is so widely used in cafes which have amazing equipment but not always experienced baristas.   You also get a different mouthfeel which may be entirely preferable to you. I personally enjoy the siltiness of a French press but others not so much.   It’s also easier which is big. What’s worse than bad coffee? No coffee. A pour over can be a big PITA.

But if youre like me and prefer a clean clear cup of coffee you can still get that from the French press. Just hack it with paper filters.  I use 2 paper filters in my French press. I cut out circles out of regular paper filters about 1 cm bigger than the size of the metal filter assembly. Then I push the filters through the center of the bottom part of the assembly (where you screw in the plunger) thus making a hole through the filters. I place the rest of the assembly (mesh and spring) and screw in the plunger.  I use a medium-coarse grind and I brew the coffee for about 6 minutes total. Bloom for 45 seconds then fill then a gentle stir at about 4:30 and plunge at 6:00.  I love it.

I havent checked in on that scene lately but there are several good ones around that price. It was definitely a step up from my Virtuoso. Since the French press is my usual method its not too much work less than a minute for a 12oz cup. Grinding for filter brews takes about twice as long. The quality is comparable to the $300 Fellow Ode I used to have.   Im very happy with it. Ive used it almost daily for over 5 years and it has been tossed in my backpack tossed in my suitcase and inspected by skeptical TSA agents many times.

I guess interpret that how you will. I think this is not a definitive conclusion though because everyones brewing with different circumstances coffees equipment tastes etc.   I will say though just to add in my own experience you can still absolutely get insanely fruity acidic vibrant cups from an immersion brewer. French press will always have a different texture with a bit more body but that absolutely does not take away from the delicate fruity notes of a fine Ethiopian dry process coffee for example. Good coffee is gonna taste better than cheap coffee no matter how you brew it.,i2dd6uf,/r/Coffee/comments/tpnea1/is_french_press_worthy_of_fancy_expensive_freshly/i2dgboh/'

A coffeeseur told me it should be fine to keep as those are where the separated oils will be. Makes sense to me but yeah I have no source for that nor a great understanding of coffee  I’m not a huge fan of the oiliness myself nor am I a fan of silt so the Hoffman strat works great but if you’re prepared to put up with potentially a little more sediment if you WANT the oil then all you need to do is stir and let it sit  Either way if you try it and it works well for you lmk!,i2cv22p,/r/Coffee/comments/tpnea1/is_french_press_worthy_of_fancy_expensive_freshly/i2eha6r/'

i2c7svs,2022-03-27 10:55:33,Haldaemo,tpl2hf,How to brew coffee without smell?,I wonder if with some brew methods if grinding finer and lowering the temperature would reduce the brewing aroma. It certainly wouldnt eliminate it. And I should note that trading off temperature and grind size to keep the same level of extraction will not result in the same taste nuances.  If you are able to brew under a stoves vent hood and if your stove exhaust fan vents to the outside as opposed to recirculating the air I find it works better with a kitchen window completely open. I used to just crack it open a little but wide open is significantly better. I fried bacon this morning and my wife can barely tell. We dont mind the smell of bacon but dont the greasy air around the house.   If there is a small cabinet area above the vent hood you can see if there is exhaust ductwork. Hopefully the vent hood isnt right under a microwave oven. Many of these vent hoods are convertible from venting and recirculating (through the mesh aluminum filter). Ive seen contractors install these convertible vent hoods in multiple homes leaving the diverter in the recirculate position.  Check if there is strong air flow exiting the recirculation slits. On the ones I have seen the hood needs to be removed and re-installed to change the diverter position. I have been able to do this for myself and also a friend without disconnecting any wires. Four hands instead of two is easier.  For even better air flow remove the aluminum mesh or carbon filter for brewing coffee.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpl2hf/how_to_brew_coffee_without_smell/i2c7svs/'

i2eoiyn,2022-03-27 23:07:45,thejadsel,tpjp46,Spring from my french press came off,It took me a minute too but this seems to be the coil that goes around the edge of the plunger in a lot of models including [this Bodum](https://www.bodum.com/se/en/01-1512-16-613-component?gclid=CjwKCAjwloCSBhAeEiwA3hVo_f-qLQJTTepxxKOoe4rwWMXxZG4UnJGcuj40lSu-JvJ-YIeQXp-oZxoCqscQAvD_BwE).   My best guess is that they are probably meant to help keep the filter screen fitting more tightly around the sides. I really used to hate those when it came time for cleaning beyond a good hot rinse and it took some scrubbing around there with a toothbrush before I discovered Cafiza.  Though I am a bit confused as to how it came off? With all the presses Ive used the coil is threaded around through the metal of one plunger piece as shown better in [this plunger assembly video](https://youtu.be/znyfMvGOXMs). (Which I looked at hoping it might address the coil piece!) If thats the case I dont see how to get it back on without reversing the fiddly process of feeding it around back through all the carrier holes.   [ETA: Looking at the photo more closely it looks like theres a plastic rim piece near the edge just holding it in a circle inside? If so Im even more stumped about how to reasonably get the thing back in right.)  At that point I would personally just get a new press or a replacement plunger. Bodum sells the metal plates that the spring attaches through as shown in the first link. No idea about other brands. The glass carafes are all Ive ever needed to replace.,i2bidhi,/r/Coffee/comments/tpjp46/spring_from_my_french_press_came_off/i2eoiyn/'

i2bii81,2022-03-27 07:56:53,zombimuncha,tpjknh,Time to upgrade my Feldgrind 2?,I forget which version my Feld is - the dial is quite small does that help? Anyway I also have a Vario and in the cup its better at everything than the Feld. Feld obviously is quiet and fits in a backpack but everything from espresso to french press is consistently better from the Vario. Its perhaps not as big a jump as from Skerton to Feld but its not subtle. And this is before Ive successfully completed the so-called Alicorn hyper-alignment mod on the Vario so theres still a little headroom apparently. The biggest downside i see is that the adjustment range isnt big enough to go from espresso to french press without recalibrating which is a pain in the arse. Itll happily flipflop between spro and V60 just by moving the macro lever tho.  Edit: i re-read your post - you dont spro? So look into the brew focused steel burr version. Thatll cover all your bases.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpjknh/time_to_upgrade_my_feldgrind_2/i2bii81/'
i2c11be,2022-03-27 10:09:00,drinking-coffee,tpjknh,Time to upgrade my Feldgrind 2?,I recently went from a feldgrind (1 but I think its the same burrs) to a j-max and in cant say I noticed a big difference in quality but I never bothered to try any side by side tests before I gave the feldgrind away.  I do however like the experience more and the (tiny tiny) steps make it a lot easier to make adjustments and switch between beans. It grinds faster and smoother (really really light beans for espresso can be intense though) and feels nice.  James Hoffman made a comment in his video on high end handgrinders something like: once youre in that range of quality the differences are small/subtle. I think that rings true. Im happy with my upgrade though and I really loved the feldgrind.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpjknh/time_to_upgrade_my_feldgrind_2/i2c11be/'

i2bncmp,2022-03-27 08:32:17,Local-Win5677,tpjknh,Time to upgrade my Feldgrind 2?,Having steps is very convenient unless you’re doing espresso. If you’re drip brewing with a few different methods (OP said he switches between FP v60 and AP) having steps is nice because it’s easy to go back and forth between settings so you don’t have to re-dial things in. And stepless isn’t really a huge benefit for drip unlike espresso.,i2b6f9s,/r/Coffee/comments/tpjknh/time_to_upgrade_my_feldgrind_2/i2bncmp/'

I am unsure if unsealing it would mess it up in any way but I didnt really have issues with taste tests causing the total flavor to be off back when I did cold brew.

i2b3ovk,2022-03-27 05:53:10,BetterSupermarket110,tpivsq,Is my hand grinder ok?,Short answer No. Ceramic grinders for coffee is not good. You will have inconsistent grind sizes. The screw lock will also keep on loosening (thats why youll get mix of dusty grounds and chunks). You will grind for eternity with it too.  But its not a total waste. I originally bought a ceramic one too. Its very good for grinding spices like peppercorns coriander seeds etc. Low end coffee grinders are still better than small cheap pepper mills. So if you do cook set it aside for that purpose.  Get a grinder with metal burrs. One of the cheaper option out there is a Timemore C2 (or the max version). Its around $50. Definitely save up for a good grinder. A good grinder even without other coffee equipment can go a long way.  PS. if $50 is still out of your price range I suggest you buy pre-grounded coffee instead. And of course check for reviews for the coffee supplier. If it has good reviews youre better off buying pre-ground coffee from them rather than grind with a ceramic grinder. Promise this is coming from a guy who initially bought a ceramic grinder.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpivsq/is_my_hand_grinder_ok/i2b3ovk/'

i2bjowx,2022-03-27 08:05:36,Dogrel,tpivsq,Is my hand grinder ok?,Yes it’s ok. You have to be a little careful with ceramic grinders. Don’t run them dry if at all possible because the burrs can chip if they grind against each other.   Also coarser grinds are always going to be less uniform than finer grinds. It’s just the way it goes.  Beans are not uniform in size and sometimes finer bits come out.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpivsq/is_my_hand_grinder_ok/i2bjowx/'

i2cvkpn,2022-03-27 13:46:00,Vernicious,tphtrk,Questions about Clever Dripper vs Pourover devices.,IMO Clever is absolutely not a replacement for a v60.  That doesnt mean its bad.  But I generally agree with the common wisdom on immersion vs pourovers: immersion for consistency body and balance pourovers for brightness and complexity.  One is not inherently better than the other but your tastebuds might have a preference or even a different preference based on difference beans.   The Clever is nearly a straight up immersion brewer the final drain makes only a small difference.   If you want to maximize brightness and complexity the Clever is the wrong choice.  If youd gotten a Hario Switch instead of the Clever you could use the same filter papers for both and use it both the same way as the Clever or as a straight v60 and have both,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tphtrk/questions_about_clever_dripper_vs_pourover_devices/i2cvkpn/'

i2e6otx,2022-03-27 20:08:40,TYBOxLIVE,tphtrk,Questions about Clever Dripper vs Pourover devices.,For me a Clever is a totally different style (immersion) compared to a v60 or Chemex (pass through).  I always use the 3 mentioned methods every time I get new beans and the Clever just absolutely brews a beautiful cup.  It’s got a very distinct mouthfeel that tends to pull out the sweetness of a given coffee. Many agree that immersion is the better expression of a high quality coffee but it is of course a matter of preference.  I usually brew a single cup using v60 with a new bag and then work my way to the Clever as the week goes on.  Then I’ll dial in a chemex to make more coffee on the weekends,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tphtrk/questions_about_clever_dripper_vs_pourover_devices/i2e6otx/'
i2fyv0b,2022-03-28 07:48:23,redsunstar,tphtrk,Questions about Clever Dripper vs Pourover devices.,Short answer: yes.  Long answer: The Clever offers four dialing axes grind size immersion time water temperature and composition.   A pour-over device offers pouring structure (one pour two pours...) and pouring technique both are large additions.  But frankly even if one is a percolation device and the other immersion one you can dial in both to get quite close results. The key here is flavour balance neither brewer is going to radically change the flavours you get just the balance.   If that makes sense you can think of the flavour balance you can achieve through a brewer as a set of point in a dial-in space.   In the abstract I think a pour-over device has both points that cover more space and less space between each point.   But in practice it doesnt matter that much. The dial in space offered by the Clever is large enough and has plenty of granularity. Unless you happen you seek very specific a very specific flavour balance outside of that space it doesnt matter at all.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tphtrk/questions_about_clever_dripper_vs_pourover_devices/i2fyv0b/'

i2c98zh,2022-03-27 11:05:36,polce24,tpgttu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Hi everyone - question on bitter V60 cups...  Let me start by saying that I am a huge coffee noob.  I got an Aeropress as a gift over the holidays and that opened up the door to this sub and the eventual purchase of a scale/kettle/V60.     Ive been following Hoffmans technique but cannot seem to take the bitterness out of my brew.  I often see here that his videos should not be taken as gospel and to adjust if needed.  I stick to his recommendation of 30g coffee/500g water but have made various adjustments with no luck.     Adjustments:     1. Water temp - Ive tried boiling water all the way down to 80C.  Less bitter at lower temps but still very much there.  I also use filtered water.   2. Grinding coarser - Ive gone from medium fine to medium to coarse.  Same bitter result.   3. More water during bloom phase - Ive tried 60g water during bloom up to 90g.     This leaves me wondering if my brew time is just incorrect for the beans that I have.  Like I said above Ive been using Hoffmans recipe so that would be 45s bloom 30s to get to 300g 30s to get to 500g total.  Drawn down almost always hits around 3m 30s as he suggests.     Ive gotten pretty good at getting the water in down to the second on his recipe.  So to me my flow rate seems to be correct too.  Is flow rate even that big of a factor?     Also thought maybe my beans could be bad.  They are from a local roaster and smell just fine to me but like I said huge noob so who knows?       I appreciate any help or suggestions!,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpgttu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2c98zh/'

What beans are you using? Are they roasted for pourovers? Darker/espresso roasts are always going to be somewhat bitter.   I love JH but I am not the greatest fan of his v60 method. Nothing against the method either just I prefer sweet juicy and high clarity cups and I dont mind sacrificing some body for it. My v60 pours normally finishes around 2:15.

i2d8dfh,2022-03-27 15:27:49,thejadsel,tpgttu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,Agreed it should work fine with either of those options. I used filter preground for French press on the daily for years with decent results before I started grinding my own. Half the time I will still just use the same setting for immersion methods and auto-drip. They are so much more flexible as to grind size.   If youve been using a finer grind for Aeropress you might want to increase the steeping time a bit for extraction with filter grind. Maybe Havent personally noticed that timing makes much difference with French press since its hard to overextract immersion unless you go completely OTT with the stirring.,i2b2mce,/r/Coffee/comments/tpgttu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2d8dfh/'

You can always adjust your recipe a bit to brew slightly more concentrate and add more bypass this should help. Waiting a min or 2 after boiling can also help with coffee that you find have a bit of woody notes too. However if one of the bag you bought is the 9BB this one has an oak/mint/honey suckle/juniper type of woodiness/herbal notes to it as it is the coffee itself. Hope this helps.,i2b2odl,/r/Coffee/comments/tpgttu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2brhge/'
i2b2t20,2022-03-27 05:44:37,MikeTheBlueCow,tpgttu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,I would look for a medium roast Brazil. But really Central or South American beans will tend to have that sort of taste profile at least in a medium roast.  One thing thats always fun to do is check out local roasters as they often have a good variety and are freshly roasted (within the past week). Look for something with tasting notes that seem appealing to you. The important part is to find one that isnt too dark because it will often be too bitter or smokey (avoid beans with any sort of shine to them youre looking for more of a medium brown shade like milk chocolate not dark chocolate).   Another option is to buy online and one way to go is a subscription since they often have quizzes to find out your preferences. Popular subscriptions are Trade Atlas Angels Cup and Bottomless. Theyre usually easy to pause or cancel.  For a specific recommendation George Howell coffee roasters is a well known option that offers a good quality roast and you might give them a browse but I would think [Tarrazu espresso](https://store.georgehowellcoffee.com/coffees/espresso-tarrazu.html) or [Daterra espresso](https://store.georgehowellcoffee.com/coffees/daterra-south-italian-style-espresso.html) would be good choices. I know the Daterra mentions blueberry but it is likely mild and from my personal experience even though I have the same dessert preferences as you that really captured my interest in coffee was the fruity notes since they are surprising and different than your average cup of joe.  Brew method is also important but if you just buy a simple French Press or a Clever Dripper it is all very simple and easier to get a good cup than a standard drip maker.,i2aul61,/r/Coffee/comments/tpgttu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2b2t20/'
i2bsbgz,2022-03-27 09:07:41,IncidentalIncidence,tpgttu,[MOD] The Daily Question Thread,that wasnt my experience at all went from the Hario Mini Mill+ to the Timemore C2 and it was night and day. But it depends on how youre brewing I guess.   Personally I didnt upgrade until I could taste and identify the specific shortcomings of the Hario grinder in my coffee. And I likely wont ditch the Timemore until Ive developed my palate enough that I can taste its issues.   That said it depends on how youre brewing: pour-over is going to be more sensitive to grind than a french press or immersion brews.   Also an underrated aspect of a grinder upgrade is the consistency -- with the Hario I regularly had good cups that I just couldnt replicate even if I didnt change anything between brews just because the grinds werent always consistent. The Timemore makes it much easier to replicate good brews in that sense.,i2br6ia,/r/Coffee/comments/tpgttu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2bsbgz/'

The grind size distribution of the timemore is just miles ahead that of the hario -- the tails on both sides of the histogram are a lot closer to the target particle size. You have less boulders less fines and a lot more particles closer to the size theyre supposed to be because the inner burr of the Timemore is much more radially stable compared to that of the Hario.,i2bx2s8,/r/Coffee/comments/tpgttu/mod_the_daily_question_thread/i2ci4yv/'

i2a1tk5,2022-03-26 21:40:22,Gramernatzi,tpcl7g,What roast level is best for French Press?,Any. Its a coffee-brewing device you can brew any roast you want in it. But its worth noting that for darker roasts you dont want them to steep as long because they get bitter faster. Lighter roasts you can let sit in the press for a good while.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tpcl7g/what_roast_level_is_best_for_french_press/i2a1tk5/'
i2a5gou,2022-03-26 22:21:11,urmomisfun,tpcl7g,What roast level is best for French Press?,It is entirely a preference thing. However I think that if you want coffee that doesnt need cream or sugar - go with a solid roaster (3rd wave) and go medium roast at the darkest. Im a huge fan of Cat & Cloud out of Santa Cruz California. But there are hundreds of awesome 3rd wave roasters killing it across the world right now.

i2abeka,2022-03-26 23:36:36,Gramernatzi,tpcl7g,What roast level is best for French Press?,Its entirely up to taste. French Presses brew coffee with an immersion method and a metal filter meaning coffee steeps in water and that only solid grounds (and usually not all of them) get filtered out leaving a lot of oils in the cup. Some people prefer this and call it body but others do not like it as it can create a strong flavor that is unpreferable for some. Pouring it through a paper filter works to remove the oils and fine coffee particles but if you prefer paper filter coffee Id just recommend using a Clever Dripper which uses the same brewing style but is much much simpler to use and clean. Also since you mentioned a Keurig I figure Id mention that the number one way to increase coffee quality is to use fresh grounds. This is because coffee begins to lose flavor very quickly after grinding (after about 15 minutes or so) and only gets worse over time. Even a Keurig can make amazing coffee if youre using freshly ground coffee in a reusable cup of course.,i2a7h1i,/r/Coffee/comments/tpcl7g/what_roast_level_is_best_for_french_press/i2abeka/'

i28zsug,2022-03-26 16:07:57,JarickL,tp6vha,Splurged on some new pour over gear this week (1ZPRESSO Stagg XF kettle),Ive been making pour over coffee for the last few years mostly using a Capresso Infinity electric grinder a Hario V60 (all three sizes) and a regular electric kettle. This week I decided to pull the trigger on some new gear to improve the quality of my 2-3 cups per day.  I started with the gooseneck kettle which is a cheaper Bodum but really helps to control the water (of course). With the old kettle it was trying to control the dumping of water but now I can pour much slower and more precise. I may end up with a nicer one like the Stagg or Bonavita at some point but for now this does the job.  Next I decided to try a little different type of pour over so I picked up the Stagg XF. I typically brew two cups in the morning so this would be a good way to do it in one go and it came with a nice carafe that would keep it a little warmer. I was surprised how much bolder and sweeter the coffee is compared to the V60 and am looking forward to dialing it in.  Then I figured Ive got to go all in and picked up the 1ZPRESSO JX hand grinder. My first grinder was a $20 POS from Amazon which took 90 seconds to grind 15 grams. Boy this is a different class altogether. The quality is really outstanding and I can grind 15 grams in closer to 20 seconds. There was a lot of static initially but using the RDT method that was solved.  I was really amazed at how different the V60 brews with the 1ZPRESSO compared to the electric grinder. Previously there were big chunks of coffee that would stick to the sides of the filter and I had to constantly mix it around with chopsticks. Now theres almost no coffee stuck to the sides the slurry moves around easily when I swirl and the coffee is definitely richer tasting.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tp6vha/splurged_on_some_new_pour_over_gear_this_week/i28zsug/'

One time I mixed the last few grams of a Costa Rican anaerobic with a Kenya Kiandu AB and it was a deliciously fruity full bodied and flavorful combination.    Sometimes if I have an unexciting coffee I will mix some brighter sweeter coffees to give it more flavor.

So that means when you do what you describe youre really getting very very diminishing returns leaving most of the round 2 and round 3 grounds un- or at least under-extracted.

i29yog1,2022-03-26 21:07:34,fluffycritter,tp5hv3,Has anyone ever experimented with mixing two different coffee grounds together to create their own unique flavor?,My understanding is that while the flavor compounds saturate pretty quickly there’s a lot of room for more caffeine to get dissolved in which is why espresso has a strong flavor but relatively weak caffeine while cold brew is the other way around.,i29w38o,/r/Coffee/comments/tp5hv3/has_anyone_ever_experimented_with_mixing_two/i29yog1/'

Ive seen scientists say that cold brew actually has *less* caffeine than hot brew:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404565/  [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cold-brew-caffeine-content\_n\_593eab44e4b0c5a35ca17350](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cold-brew-caffeine-content_n_593eab44e4b0c5a35ca17350)  [https://www.foodandwine.com/news/hot-and-cold-brew-coffee-difference-science](https://www.foodandwine.com/news/hot-and-cold-brew-coffee-difference-science),i29yog1,/r/Coffee/comments/tp5hv3/has_anyone_ever_experimented_with_mixing_two/i2ejl84/'
i2eo3q8,2022-03-27 23:02:36,fluffycritter,tp5hv3,Has anyone ever experimented with mixing two different coffee grounds together to create their own unique flavor?,Im not positive about it at all its just what Ive heard from various sources and also in my experience as someone who is highly caffeine-sensitive I definitely get more of an effect from coldbrew than fully-brewed stuff. Also it seems consistent with how the Swiss water method works.  From that first article the [measured caffeine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7404565/table/foods-09-00902-t001/) is somewhat higher in two of the three cold brews (R1 and R3) than the hot brews though even though the TDS was lower and the remaining sample (R2) was so close in caffeine concentration that theyre essentially the same.  The other two articles dont seem to control for roast/bean origin and are just looking at things in general samples so Im not sure how much Id trust them.,i2ejl84,/r/Coffee/comments/tp5hv3/has_anyone_ever_experimented_with_mixing_two/i2eo3q8/'
i2exk6e,2022-03-28 01:09:51,icecream_for_brunch,tp5hv3,Has anyone ever experimented with mixing two different coffee grounds together to create their own unique flavor?,Sure but the point is that categorical claims like espresso has a strong flavor but relatively weak caffeine while cold brew is the other way around are untenable and I think youd agree that all three sources support that point. Im not married to this of course but unless theres some solid data showing otherwise Im going to stick with the research that Ive seen.,i2eo3q8,/r/Coffee/comments/tp5hv3/has_anyone_ever_experimented_with_mixing_two/i2exk6e/'
i2eyqie,2022-03-28 01:27:42,fluffycritter,tp5hv3,Has anyone ever experimented with mixing two different coffee grounds together to create their own unique flavor?,But based on that first paper I think its still fair to say that brew method makes a difference and given the same beans roast level and dose youre likely to get more caffeine and less flavor from cold brew and more flavor and less caffeine from espresso. And the other two links dont provide any data at all unless theres something I completely missed. I mean I even linked directly to the table from the first paper which backs up exactly what I said.  Obviously if you change other variables then youre going to change the results as well and if youre choosing different beans brewed at different coffee shops and so on then youre changing a *lot* of variables.  I never made the claim that *all* espresso has less caffeine and more flavor than *all* cold brew and yes the beans themselves are probably a much bigger factor than the brew method when it comes to what youre going to get out of it. But also the whole reason why many people brew cold brew is that it provides a much milder smoother flavor and thats a direct result of the actual profile of the specific dissolved compounds.,i2exk6e,/r/Coffee/comments/tp5hv3/has_anyone_ever_experimented_with_mixing_two/i2eyqie/'
i2ezbdl,2022-03-28 01:36:25,fluffycritter,tp5hv3,Has anyone ever experimented with mixing two different coffee grounds together to create their own unique flavor?,Im genuinely curious how weve seemingly read the same papers but come to different conclusions from them.  What data are you seeing that tells you that the opposite is true from what I said?  Also the first link keeps everything equal between the two brews including contact time and volume however espresso is a very different brewing method than cold brew what with having a much lower volume shorter contact time and higher pressure. Do you have any sources that compare with data extraction ratios for espresso vs. drip and/or cold brew? Ideally keeping the input dose the same?  All I have to go on is my personal anecdotes with tasting coffee and feeling the relative effect of caffeine as well as the various posts around r/coffee and r/espresso and other coffee discussion forums which are of course highly subjective to begin with. Id love to see data that makes a scientific comparison between those things but I havent found any which is why in my first post I said it is my understanding not it is an absolute fact.,i2exk6e,/r/Coffee/comments/tp5hv3/has_anyone_ever_experimented_with_mixing_two/i2ezbdl/'

i27m8rv,2022-03-26 09:58:41,weprechaun29,tovdj7,What’s your personal trick/tip for making coffee in a French press?,This might sound dumb but my French press brews always seemed better when I boiled water on the stove using a schott glass carafe. Something about the hot water hitting the grounds made the coffee bloom nicer. Normally I just heat water in the electric kettle because Im impatient. Theyre both hot water but the stovetop method seems to offer something more. Again could be wrong.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tovdj7/whats_your_personal_tricktip_for_making_coffee_in/i27m8rv/'

i27rr5k,2022-03-26 10:37:22,grrrrtt,tovdj7,What’s your personal trick/tip for making coffee in a French press?,Probably not the trick your looking for but when I make a French Press I kinda just DGAF it. The method is so forgiving in my opinion that I kind of just let it ride. I won’t be precise on measuring beans since I kind of know how much I want. I won’t be super precise about grinding (I find anything coarser than a medium-course is fine). And I won’t care about temperature anything hot enough to scald you is fine. I find it kind of freeing in a coffee culture that seems to sweat the small stuff all the time.   Don’t get me wrong I loving sweating the small stuff and will be annoyingly precise when I make a pour over. But sometimes you just gotta throw water and grounds in a French press and not think too much about it.,-,/r/Coffee/comments/tovdj7/whats_your_personal_tricktip_for_making_coffee_in/i27rr5k/'

i27sdos,2022-03-26 10:41:50,grrrrtt,tovdj7,What’s your personal trick/tip for making coffee in a French press?,I think he strains his grounds through a paper towel when he is cleaning up.

i27rhgc,2022-03-26 10:35:29,almondmilk,tovdj7,What’s your personal trick/tip for making coffee in a French press?,I wouldnt say its tough or difficult but the most annoying and time consuming. For me its the worst in that the other methods I use (Aeropress pour over moka pot) are much quicker and easier with the moka pot being worst of the 3 by far. With the French press the damn grounds are always caked to the bottom so Im trying to bang glass in a small trashcan awkwardly positioned under the sink before having to scoop and scrape the grounds out by hand and then wash the beaker. If I didnt mind pouring 50 or whatever grams of coffee down the sink itd be easier. But I wont do that.  The main plus is that the press I have is the 8 cup so I can make much more at once. On the flip side because of this is also the most cleanup. Ive actually never used a smaller one.,i27p7s9,/r/Coffee/comments/tovdj7/whats_your_personal_tricktip_for_making_coffee_in/i27rhgc/'
i27ss09,2022-03-26 10:44:37,weprechaun29,tovdj7,What’s your personal trick/tip for making coffee in a French press?,I have a 1.75L press. After Im done I add a little water then dump the grounds in the trash. Several plumbers said the drains ok to dump provided that you flush with cold water. If all the grounds dont come out a bit more water is swished around then in the trash they go. Never been an issue. If I really wanted I could always have a dedicated grounds bucket then toss the grounds outside in the yard.  So far havent needed any tools to scrape out grounds & never any leaks in the trash. I even have a wire mesh strainer in the sink to catch coffee grounds or bits of tea leaves that I can easily dump into the trash.,i27rhgc,/r/Coffee/comments/tovdj7/whats_your_personal_tricktip_for_making_coffee_in/i27ss09/'

i28dern,2022-03-26 13:16:39,nach0ladas,tov8yy,Growing frustrated with SMEG grinder,Mate a SMEG is not a good piece of kit. Let’s also be clear that there are not really any grinders that do all-around and do it well. There’s espresso and there’s filter grind. The niche anecdotally may be able to handle both.

I did some online research watched YouTube product reviews and even talked to friends that said sure youre paying more for the sleek look but the grinder is good quality too. Guess they were wrong and I should just go with something else.  So what does everyone use to get both fine espresso and coarse grinds from the same machine without any jams? Im hearing Eureka?

i29cpbk,2022-03-26 17:52:56,Eicr-5,tov8yy,Growing frustrated with SMEG grinder,Niche is gonna be a fair bit more than the smeg. Though it’s apparently great especially for espresso.

i28ewjq,2022-03-26 13:27:52,SolidUpstairs,tov8yy,Growing frustrated with SMEG grinder,it means you gotta clean it out more if you want to keep using them. Ive jammed my eureka with oily beans.   There are dark roasts out there that arent oily though they are probably more in the medium-dark range vs the roasted-until-it-cries stuff from Starbucks. Those will give you a better tasting cup and not clog your grinder but they are more expensive usually. its a tradeoff 🤷,i27qy5y,/r/Coffee/comments/tov8yy/growing_frustrated_with_smeg_grinder/i28ewjq/'
