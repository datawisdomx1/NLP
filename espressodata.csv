Find some long sewing needles (8 or so) and a long wine cork and that was my DAILY driver for a good 6 months with zero complaint and served the purpose of a WDT in getting everything even and ready to tamp. Jus a slight tap to settle and ready to go. Such a low cost with every day items but the results when you see the first drops of espresso are amazing. I‚Äôd argue that a well groomed bed of coffee a great tamper and a funnel to keep everything in are core.,i50tjbq,/r/espresso/comments/u53110/i_have_600_budget_looking_for_recommendations_for/i50wfea/'

i510j6h,2022-04-16 18:13:23,DogFoodMood,u54v64,DF64 - advice on the collar?,Turn the collar finer (with the grinder powered off) until you feel resistance. Take your fingers and squeeze middle screw carrier and then turn clockwise until you hear the burrs touch. If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll have to keep adjusting the collar finer to accomplish this. Then check again. You‚Äôll feel and hear it. This is your new zero. You can either get a blow dryer and heat up the dial indicator sticker that‚Äôs on the grinder and reposition it so it aligns with the new zero (what I did) or you can simply set your own dial indicator ring (if you bought one) to this new zero point.   No your alignment will not be affected with taking the collar on and off.   I occasionally check the springs to make sure they are still well seated as I‚Äôve heard this can change alignment.

i5129qb,2022-04-16 18:27:37,Nickrii,r8tb8b,Announced: Eureka Mignon Zero,Did you try the wheel on the XL / Single Dose or the smaller one of the Specialita? Or maybe even both? I only know the smaller dials from the machines at our local store so I don‚Äôt have a direct comparison but I had the impression the bigger one on my Zero was different in feel - more than what I would expect just from the size alone. In the end I‚Äôm single dosing for freshness and not for switching brew methods so I might not be the most critical user in that regard anyway. As long as I can dial in the grind size quickly when I open a new bag of beans I‚Äôm happy - If I was switching between brew methods Id probably look at something like the Niche. It‚Äôs still more expensive than the Mignon Zero but at least roughly in the same range.  The Monolith however is ten times the price. It *ought* to be way better than a Mignon in almost every regard but size. Enjoy that beast! :),i50s8s1,/r/espresso/comments/r8tb8b/announced_eureka_mignon_zero/i5129qb/'

Way better than the Breville at a similar price level. Way more durable than any Baratza.  Main thing about 2nd hand Rockys are their burrs are probably shot and definitely not aligned. yes the stepped adjustment means its not as fine grain as it should be but that can be offset by other factors such as dose and shot ratio. Particularly on darker roasts well aligned Rocky with reasonable burrs would make very good espresso great body with good details.  At the end of the day you cannot compare this with a Niche or even a Specialita.

i4wbjq0,2022-04-15 17:05:42,According-League-345,u4kmbt,Yet another what should I upgrade to question.,Honestly I do not like the machines you picked. Isn‚Äôt the Ascaso thermoblock? That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt sound great for thermal stability. The other one is new and a bit unproven.  If you want a compact saturated group with thermal efficiency your best bet IMO is a machine like the Pro 300 Lelit Elizabeth Silvia Pro X or the Mini Vivaldi II. If you like the convenience of the HX and want a small machine Mara X could be worth looking into (people love it). But my advice would be to take your time and save a bit more. IDC has a sale every month. I am not convinced the machines you‚Äôre looking at are upgrades I think they‚Äôre a lateral move. I did that when I upgraded my Saeco to a Gaggia and i wasn‚Äôt super happy and upgraded again‚Ä¶,-,/r/espresso/comments/u4kmbt/yet_another_what_should_i_upgrade_to_question/i4wbjq0/'

i4ydnzc,2022-04-16 06:23:54,rbpx,u4kmbt,Yet another what should I upgrade to question.,Ill put in a vote for the Bellezza. When I first saw it I was amazed it had so many good design choices (eg. the pressure meter shows the brewhead pressure not the boiler pressure). Then I saw that it was on for $500 CAD discount ! Wait... what?  Then I saw that it was a new offering from a company thats been around since 2017. Oh. Theyre new. Theyre *really* new.  However looking a little further I see that they are a re-incorporation of interests that have been in the coffee machine business for a very long time. Thus I believe that this offering deserves a closer investigation.   Im no fan of the external water reservoir design but thats a small issue. I would say only that that reservoir looks awfully small. Last time I looked the P300 is $2500 CAD Elizabeth is $2400 CAD BDB was $2400 CAD (yeesh these prices!) - oh idrinkcoffes got it on for $1900 CAD. The Bellona is now on for $1500 CAD.  I really like all the design features/benefits of the Bellona and its intro price is $500 off. Im not sure I buy the company is too young fear. Ive always found that each product stands alone in that every phone or car maker has made stinkers. So the unknown reputation concern is really about this product - not the company. I wonder if a call to idrinkcoffee can answer questions like why are you carrying this product? and what is your technicians reaction to a teardown look inside?.   However this also touches on your personal sense of ***risk***. Im quite impressed with Profitec material quality and would love to blindly recommend the P300. However its quite an old featureless design (what? No preinfusion?). Dunno if you need that though. NB. The Bellona is $1000 ***less*** than the P300. That is significant.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u4kmbt/yet_another_what_should_i_upgrade_to_question/i4ydnzc/'
i5075nd,2022-04-16 14:28:08,Requirement_Virtual,u4kmbt,Yet another what should I upgrade to question.,Id like to put in the Bezzera hobby into the mix. The idrinkcoffee crew has it in stock and I think a boiler machine might be better than thermoblock.   PID is all good but youll be physically limited to what you can do with that tech. Somehow it just feels like beginner technology and theres only so much you can do by slapping on additional features on top.    Bezzera is also super tiny for the amount of power.

i4wm3lm,2022-04-15 18:31:28,annamaaae,u4kmbt,Yet another what should I upgrade to question.,I may increase my budget then to fit the Profitec 300. I do quite like the look of it over the Rancilio. The Mara X is nice and quite popular but the E61 look is just such a turn off for me.   On a side note from all the reviews I‚Äôve [watched](https://youtu.be/YU1RLVs1Koc) they seem to praise the thermal stability of the Ascaso.   I would also like to add that the reason for the upgrade is to have more modern tech like timed shots for convenience. Most of my espresso making time is done while I‚Äôm getting ready for work or school in the morning so having the ability to start the shot and walk away to do other things is quite also what I‚Äôm looking for.,i4wbjq0,/r/espresso/comments/u4kmbt/yet_another_what_should_i_upgrade_to_question/i4wm3lm/'

Its quite the risk but with the VIM warranty im less scared of the risk.   From the research ive gathered too apparently Bellezza is a more affordable branch by ECM. This made me feel a bit better.

Theres typically nothing wrong with them they just need cleaning (especially if they were in homes with smokers) to get them fully functional again. Or theres one tiny linkage that needs a simple 5 second reattachment. Third most likely issue is the draw band broke/disintegrated. In many cases thats just a $0.05 repair with some fishing line or similar. So I can buy them for $5 or even get them free. Spend one hour cleaning. And sell for $100 or more. I never saw myself as mechanical or a tinkerer for the first 42 years of my life but this is now a great hobby. Less electronics though.

This is sometimes why this sub seems wildly insane. It doesnt really take a lot of experience or high-end tools to out perform the vast majority of retail shops. Yes there are quality coffee shops that one might aspire and struggle to match at home but such shops are few and far between. There may be some urban enclaves where one can walk from one quality shop to another on the same block but for many of us our home pulls despite use of a wdt tool with tines greater than .5mm or with obvious channelling is still the best we have ever had.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u4gutj/still_processing_pulling_shots_at_home_that_are/i4vntys/'

I can‚Äôt recommend a hand grinder for espresso personally at least with the Lido E it was too much of a workout for me to want to deal with it regularly. If you‚Äôre serious about the decaf being good the DF64 Sette 270 or other ~$400 dedicated espresso grinder are probably the best bet.

Got home from a longgggg work week pretty damn tired so finishing the week off with a little espresso before hitting the bottle.   17 in 36 out over 25s with a 4s pre infusion I always find this blend to taste darker than the roast indicates.

i4wz4sm,2022-04-15 20:21:47,iamnotdunningkruger,u4gjex,Friday Gibraltar,Try a tiny pitcher like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Dailyart-Frothing-Espresso-Accessory-Stainless/dp/B07SCYVZC8/).  I use it for my oat milk cortados every morning and it works great with no waste.  I fill to just below the 3oz line so about 2oz and use the 2-hole tip on my Bianca.  Takes like 15-20 seconds.    Be careful though because the pitcher gets hot really fast and its easy to blow the milk over the side onto your hand.  Also see [here](https://www.home-barista.com/tips/steaming-small-amount-milk-t74735.html) [here](https://www.home-barista.com/tips/good-small-milk-pitcher-t76489.html) and [here](https://www.home-barista.com/tips/cortado-help-t61112.html).  There are other threads but those will get you started.  E: dont turn the steam on all the way.  Turn it on a little at first then up slowly not too far.  Youll get a feel for it eventually.,i4vrvia,/r/espresso/comments/u4gjex/friday_gibraltar/i4wz4sm/'
i4vto58,2022-04-15 14:45:43,antheus1,u4gjex,Friday Gibraltar,Sadly I waste a lot of milk. I use 8 oz in a 14 oz pitcher so basically a bit under the bottom part of the spout. You can definitely get smaller pitchers. The main issue with steaming smaller quantities of milk are that the milk may scald before you‚Äôre able to make/incorporate microfoam so you could potentially just put less milk in the pitcher and leave it over ice in the freezer for a bit so that the milk and pitcher are cooler before you start steaming allowing you to steam a bit longer but I‚Äôve never done that and I just waste a bit of milk. Most of the time my milk goes bad because I don‚Äôt use it all so I‚Äôm ok with wasting a bit.,i4vrvia,/r/espresso/comments/u4gjex/friday_gibraltar/i4vto58/'

When it comes to ECS I wasnt aware about it being a grey market seller. the price difference could very well be because of the seller and the manufacturer being in the same region and not having any exclusivity there like SCG does in US for Notte resulting in price gauging.,i4vjsdr,/r/espresso/comments/u4gj59/huge_scratches_on_new_eureka_mignon_manuale/i4wlnoi/'

I of course still think you are entitled to the product you ordered without issue. I have purchased from ECS myself and would have been upset if my grinder was damaged. And I think the issue you have is real if not entirely something that I or others would care about and not ECS fault still a real issue nonetheless. But I also think you were fully aware you did not pay full price for a brand new grinder because of course you didnt. You paid a discount price for a brand new grinder. Youre in the US. Your first google of Notte didnt bring you to an Italian seller that doesnt even use the same currency. It doesnt particularly matter I just thought the way you phrased that seemed pretty over the top given the circumstances.,i4wlnoi,/r/espresso/comments/u4gj59/huge_scratches_on_new_eureka_mignon_manuale/i4wqr47/'

Good on you for taking the initiative and for caring about what you‚Äôre doing.

You may not like what you‚Äôre doing but do it as best as you can anyway otherwise you‚Äôd have wasted your time doing something mediocre.  I like the idea of a cupping session with your boss and other employees so that people get to taste the different options perhaps do 3-5 ‚Äúnormal‚Äú (read:inconsistent) shots and 3-5 that you would prepare your way and see if you can convince them that way. You‚Äôd have to be able to be just as fast making your shots as the current default ones.  Sorry I‚Äôm not a barista so don‚Äôt know how to set up a manual but perhaps you could make it an exercise with one of your co-workers to draft up a ‚Äúplan of attack‚Äù of sorts.

i4vzjzn,2022-04-15 15:30:52,shellseaa,u4fc4j,Espresso beans?,i do know how to make good espresso and how to properly extract espresso and learned how to manipulate it at my other jobs. i am by far the person that has the most knowledge about coffee here and its my job to train people i just want them to have a manual to reference when im not there and so things can be consistent.,i4vypyh,/r/espresso/comments/u4fc4j/espresso_beans/i4vzjzn/'
i4w25cl,2022-04-15 15:51:16,shellseaa,u4fc4j,Espresso beans?,yeah i absolutely agree with you there. and especially starbucks i know they roast their beans a lot darker than other places because they will just sit in storage for a long time until they need to be shipped to a store. but i definitely wont do an extremely dark roast and will likely ask her to do either a medium/dark roast or just use the dark roast that we already use for our drip coffee sometimes cause i definitely dont like a super dark roast for espresso either.,i4vzt7z,/r/espresso/comments/u4fc4j/espresso_beans/i4w25cl/'
i4x2u9d,2022-04-15 20:55:42,Environmental-Dog219,u4fc4j,Espresso beans?,I have come to notice a lot of specialty coffee shops popping up around my area (here in Australia) and when I do go out for a coffee I tend to seek those places out as I‚Äôm almost guaranteed that they have a good light roast most likely filter brewed. If the coffee shop doesn‚Äôt specifically label or market itself as a specialty coffee shop it‚Äôs more than likely that they will serve a medium/dark to dark roast as that seems to be the ‚Äústandard‚Äù coffee the majority of the population has come to expect. I‚Äôm sure there is a shift happening in the industry to include lighter roasts and for customers to notice and ask for lighter roasts but that shift is still fairly gradual and I think it‚Äôs unreasonable to walk into any ‚Äúnormal‚Äù coffee shop expecting a light roast brewed in a V60. That‚Äôs probably why the home coffee segment has exploded over the last couple of years.  So depending on how OP‚Äôs employer decided to market her cafe a medium/dark or dark roast seems appropriate considering that the majority of drinks served will most likely be milk based.,i4vzt7z,/r/espresso/comments/u4fc4j/espresso_beans/i4x2u9d/'

I went down the cheap path years ago each time throwing out rubbish grinders and home espresso machines typically within a few months.

Found these on amazon but i aint sure(Ik the more money u spend the better),OP This is really good advice! I‚Äôd disagree with point 3 though. I previously held a de longhi ECP3420 and if you change up the pressurized baskets to a regular (non-pressurized) one for $10-15 it makes quite a respectable espresso. For a long time I used that machine with a hand grinder and later with a Sboly. Believe me it used to make me far better shots than most average caf√©s. The main bottleneck of the machine is temperature stability ‚Äî you‚Äôll learn to do some surfing with experience but it‚Äôs indeed frustrating (but this holds even for GCP and Silvia). Of course with non-pressurized baskets comes the responsibility of owning a grinder. But that‚Äôs for later consideration and the machine will certainly get you started. (The upgraditis you get after 5-6 months is real but you‚Äôll have that feeling regardless of what you choose initially!)

Found these on amazon but i aint sure(Ik the more money u spend the better),Oh I dont mind answering at all. Basically it comes down to two things:  1) the machines arent built very well and are not consistent to any degree. Youd get a consistent product out of a nespresso machine that would at least approximate espresso.  2) cost: you would need a good grinder to even come  close to pulling decent espresso out of this and even then youd suffer extreme volatility in pressure and temperature from the machine.   Youd either have to spend a lot of time effort and money using and modding these cheaper machines to get an ok product. And if youre ok with an ok product nespresso is just the better option for you.,i4v013w,/r/espresso/comments/u4d40n/im_looking_for_an_espresso_machine_for_around_150/i4v0knw/'

Found these on amazon but i aint sure(Ik the more money u spend the better),It‚Äôs a 51 mm portafiler/basket. I just saw that the one I bought off Amazon ain‚Äôt available anymore but they‚Äôre super easy to come by (I‚Äôm seeing so many listings on Amazon). Not sure if you‚Äôre looking for the right thing?  As for better espresso start isolating various problems with the machine/your workflow and solve them one by one. Some examples below.  The first order of business is going to be grinding your own freshly roasted beans. You surely know that it makes a whole world of difference over pre-ground (even if you‚Äôre using the pressurized basket).   Secondly try measuring the live temperature by flushing group head and collecting water in a warm cup. Then try again by putting the steam mode on for 5 10 15 seconds etc and see what exactly gets you closer to 90 deg C and start using that while brewing.  I remember temperature being one of my main issues.  This machine will NOT perform with anything lighter than ‚Äúmedium dark‚Äù profiles so don‚Äôt even bother.   Please pair it with a decent enough grinder as soon as you can. That is where good espresso really happens. The machine is just a water boiler-come-pressurizer (well for starters).,i4w3ft0,/r/espresso/comments/u4d40n/im_looking_for_an_espresso_machine_for_around_150/i4x8fhx/'

I‚Äôve been using freshly roasted beans with my aeropress and drip coffee and it is amazing. I currently use a 1Zpresso Q2 manual burr grinder and when i tried grinding at the same setting as my aeropress it choked the ECP.   I‚Äôll definitely look into your pointers for temp surfing on the machine too! Thanks!

Many manufactures have an ECO mode Rocket has a somewhat hidden switch on the bottom of their machines.  This will cut the power consumption but still keep things warm enough to quickly be ready to use.   Some machines have more programable timers for ECO and off mode in addition to what a smart plug could provide.   The discontinued smart plug Ive been using for years tracks power consumption which can easily be converted to operating costs by inputting Kw/h costs.  My machine averages 2.1 hours per day being on monthly cost is under $3 in electricity.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u4aham/e61_to_be_turned_off_or_not_to_be/i4uoteg/'

You even need to cool flush the group head a quite bit (mine needs around 100ml flush after being on for an hour)‚Ä¶  I‚Äôve got a quite good way for me: - wrap your group head & portafilter in cloth while warm up - setting your lever in the open position (open flow pump still off) - After a few minutes your portafilter & group head will be quite how due to the flush of hot water & steam. I get here to a warmup time of about 11min for a machine warm enough to serve good & consistent shots.

i4uvoi4,2022-04-15 10:42:13,rbpx,u4aham,E61: to be (turned off) or not to be?,I keep a different rule for bigger power devices than small wattage electronics. The ***most damaging*** time for your electronics is surviving the inrush current when it is first turned on cold. I remember learning that the inrush current in a (incandescent) lightbulb is 10x normal current. This is why lights rarely die during use - they mostly die immediately when you turn them on. Thus ***for electronics*** (in a small power device) I try to always leave it on. My laptop/desktop/phone/tablet are NEVER turned off (except for power cycling after updates or just trying to keep the OS functioning). I turn these off if I leave on a trip (maybe).  But a large power and heating device such as an espresso maker is different. Yes the biggest power strain to the device is when the power must first be applied in order to bring it up to temperature. After that the power usage can be 25% of full to keep it hot when idling. The other effect is that metal doesnt stay the same ***size*** when you change its temperature. The metal expands when you make it hot. This is why the quality of the materials is important. Any machine can last for a time. But what if you do this cold-hot-cold dance repeatedly day after day for years? Well it takes its toll. Switches dont like being switched on and off. This wears them down. Thus there is strain and wear caused by both the applied electric current and the heat.  The question is: which is harder on the machine? Leaving it on all day or powering it on then off then on then off again each day? My view and my experience has been that Power Supplies and heating elements and heated-elements dont like the power&heat cycles. Electronics are fine with being left on. Ive never experienced a premature degradation of electronics because of leaving them on. My electronics (which are always left on) last just as long if not longer than the next guys.  However a kettle or Pressurized-Kettle (which is what these things are) are more like automotive engines: they (noticeably) wear down with use. We all know that highway miles are easier on a car than city miles. This is because the hot/cold on/off dynamic cycles of the stopping and starting are harder on the machine. So while there is wear due to being ON all the time its the dynamics of the Power-up and power-down that are most hard on the machine.  Personally Ive never liked the idea of ***not using something*** because that ages it. I bought it for a purpose and that is to ***use*** it. So even if leaving it on or cycling it ages it more Id still do that if it fits my lifestyle. My espresso machine use is simple though. I usually have my morning coffee between 8:30am to 9:30am (not too early! This is not good for you) and if I think I might have another one (rarely) Ill leave the machine on. Otherwise it is cleaned and turned off. It is turned back on at 12:30pm for another coffee after lunch (I wait 30+ minutes for warm up). Then I turn it off. On rare occasions I have a later afternoon coffee for which Ill turn it on for that - but that is rare as I said.  Thus 80% or more of the time I turn it on twice in the day it warms up for 30 to 45 minutes is used and turned off. Because theres 4 hours or so between uses I dont leave it on.  Obviously due to heat up time if youre using it in intervals of less than X hours youre better off leaving it on. What is X? Is that 2.5? Is it 3?,-,/r/espresso/comments/u4aham/e61_to_be_turned_off_or_not_to_be/i4uvoi4/'

i4uz2ch,2022-04-15 11:05:02,rbpx,u4aham,E61: to be (turned off) or not to be?,Hmmm dunno if I was clear enough. The contest is between the wear&strain of leaving it on versus the wear&strain of power cycling it (electricity waste of leaving it on is another matter and is different for us all).   Power cycling is hardest on a machine compared to the wear caused by idling hot. However because a machine can be left to idle hot for a very long time this wear&tear accumulates: eg. the SSR used in my machine to power cycle the heating element is not a low power electronic device. It is a large current electronic device and running current through it ages it (and when idling the machine this device is switching the current on and off continually - so this device ages in use).  I dont know of any good data out there that shows how long the heating element in your boiler lasts (ie. # of hours of use). In general switching anything on and off is hardest on it but there are some devices that age (not insignificantly) as the machine idles hot.,i4uvoi4,/r/espresso/comments/u4aham/e61_to_be_turned_off_or_not_to_be/i4uz2ch/'

i4xeki5,2022-04-15 22:58:28,arentol,u48yzm,Every new cafe is a roll of the dice.,Technically what makes it a cappuccino is the ratio of espresso to milk to foam which is 1/3rd of each. Ratios should be the same no matter the size. So a 16oz is about 5.33oz of espresso 5.33oz of milk and 5.33oz of foam.  One problem is that at that ratio a typical coffee shop paper cup is going to result in way too thick a layer of foam to properly enjoy the drink. I suppose it can be made properly in a large round cup like the opening shot of So I Married an Axe Murderer ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8k\_\_drj7Lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8k__drj7Lo)). But I wouldnt want to consider having one in a 16oz paper cup.  I also guarantee that almost any shop you go to will only put 2 or 3 shots of espresso in the drink by default which would mean it is really just a latte which is usually 1/6th to 1/4th espresso (\~15-25%) to milk+foam. 2 shots (2oz) would be 12.5% espresso 3 shots would be 18.75%. So that is nowhere near the 33% you would want for a cappuccino. Even 4 shots is only 25%. So you would probably have to ask for the 5 shots (31.25%) that should be in it and if you have to ask for it then they never intended to make you a cappuccino and probably have no idea what one is and wont do the milk and foam correctly either.... So why bother at that point.,i4v60di,/r/espresso/comments/u48yzm/every_new_cafe_is_a_roll_of_the_dice/i4xeki5/'

i4xf8uv,2022-04-15 23:06:42,arentol,u48yzm,Every new cafe is a roll of the dice.,A standard cappuccino should be 6oz from what I understand  It is a 1:1:1 ratio drink so 2oz of espresso 2oz of milk 2oz of foam (this in terms of space in the cup really though so it is more like 2oz 2.5oz 1.5oz of actual weight. Still totaling 4oz of total milk actually added to the drink in the form of milk+foam.   You can do a 3-shot version totaling 9oz or a 4-shot totaling 12 of course. But if you do 2 shots of espresso in a 12oz cup then you are actually just making a latte. Even 3 shots is still a latte.

The chef brushes soy sauce on the nigiri if needed for the flavor they are going for.   Ive never been to a high end place and thought theres not enough soy sauce or this could use more wasabi etc. Youre paying a lot so everything should be spot on.   There was a restaurant in my city (SF) many years back that wasnt super expensive but trying to do things more upscale/traditional/within the chefs vision. Well lots of people didnt pay attention and would just bring their date to the restaurant and not look at the menu and start ordering. Then theyd get pissed they didnt have rainbow rolls or any rolls at all.  The chef relented at one point and gave customers a small dish of soy sauce and still got yelp reviews upset that the chef dictated how much soy sauce they should have - they wanted the bottle at the table!   It really comes down to expectations. < $100 vs $200-300+ pp for sushi is very different. Each experience is very different - but if your restaurant straddles that line the wrong way youre going to piss people off.,i4upfpe,/r/espresso/comments/u48yzm/every_new_cafe_is_a_roll_of_the_dice/i4urh33/'

But there is even more humor if you consider that some of their customers definitely knew the difference and walked out thinking What a stupid barista they dont know the difference between a cappuccino latte and flat white while the barista was thinking What a stupid customer they dont know the difference between a cappuccino latte and flat white. So they are both feeling superior.  Then of course the next level of humor is in the fact that the only one who is actually superior is the customer who knows they didnt get what they ordered because the barista is an a-hole since they knew the difference could make it right and chose instead to serve the wrong thing out of a false belief in their own superiority.

i4xdha0,2022-04-15 22:45:23,TheTybera,u48yzm,Every new cafe is a roll of the dice.,No the difference in a lot of these coffees is the ratio of espresso to milk with a latte being the most milk. As such you should always have a set amount of mL based on your espresso shot. So if youve got a double say 25ml of espresso a cappuccino would have about 85ml of milk. After foam this generally makes a 150ml or about 5oz drink.  By adding sizes that are way bigger than this youre throwing off these ratios by a lot. So depending on what shop you go to you may end up with a more bitter large if they over-add espresso or a really milky large if they just add one shot and douse the espresso with milk. This inconsistency becomes a problem not only that but then you get a drink thats more like a latte with slightly more espresso or milk than an actual drink.,i4w3pfd,/r/espresso/comments/u48yzm/every_new_cafe_is_a_roll_of_the_dice/i4xdha0/'

This isnt how it has ever been in Australia - a country with a very sophisticated (and snobbish) coffee culture in the major cities. In Sydney one of the major coffee snob cities the difference between a flat white latte and cappuccino is largely defined by how the milk is steamed and how frothy it becomes.   Flat white = milk is warmed with very little frothing  Latte = milk is frothed consistently to a creamy texture.   Cappuccino = same as a latte but the top 1cm or so is very frothy topped with chocolate powder.,i4vc4w8,/r/espresso/comments/u48yzm/every_new_cafe_is_a_roll_of_the_dice/i4xenvg/'

But what they all have in common is that there is WAY too much milk in all those coffee to gos. That snobby coffee culture is at best wannabe it contrasts well to the US because virtually all coffee shops use espresso machines instead of the vile drip Americanos. Theres also a good scene in Melbourne in the still genuine Italian heritage quarters. But apart from that its all very mediocre. Consider for example the short black which is the smallest unit of black coffee you can order in most places.

Thats a funny question here in /r/coffeesnob :D  Look I agree to each their own if people want a gallon of milk with faint coffee flavour they should go for it. What bothers me with Australia in particular is that they make such a big deal of their supposedly sophisticated coffee culture when really most of what they drink is high quantities of warm low-quality milk sprinkled with pointlessly over-prepared (because of how much they dilute it) coffee shots.  But again I can see where that came from they are very proud that Starbucks didnt really take hold over there and that they have independent chains instead and all that. But really its just Starbucks all over again only that they use Espresso as a base instead of Americano.

Our perception of taste depends on both smell and the receptors on our tongue. In the limit where we obstruct our smell completely or bypass our tongue (e.g. drinking by straw) well certainly alter the profile of what were tasting.   There are also ways to physically direct vapours closer to our nose while drinking such that we get a higher concentration going into our nose - for an example wines are typical but also whiskeys where the evaporation rate of alcohol is much higher.   So yes there are physically viable reasons for things affecting taste and the rate at which the liquid/gases enter you. Having said that are they significantly different? Id say no for coffee at least. As long as youre not bypassing completely e.g. plugged nose + straw then most cups will behave similarly. Id guess the most likely contributor isnt the glass shape here but rather the vacuum double-wall. For me the biggest contributor to tasting coffee is certainly the temperature and having decent insulation allows the coffee to stay in my optimal range for a longer time than a ceramic or metal container.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u48iti/can_these_alter_taste_profiles_as_claimed_by_the/i4udo3n/'

Much better tasting than a mug thermos or paper cup. Only slightly better flavor than a bodum but the sturdiness makes up for the replacement cost of bodums.

i4ue7n0,2022-04-15 08:45:04,Mike_From_GO,u475t4,Switched to a non-calibrated tamper and couldn‚Äôt be happier,Yes.  Some workflow things of note to follow up with James Hoffmanns video review:  RDT does make a different.  What helps in conjunction with that is wiping the inside of the tumbler with a dry paper towel every few shots to get the slight fines residue out.  Ive had significantly less sticking when its clean.   The other thing Ive found a really firm tap on the counter with the tumblr on the portafilter isnt always needed a lighter tap and then holding the tumbler to the basket a gentle and quick circular motion seems to level things out nicely.  Ive seen Weber do this in a few of their older videos.   I stopped using the $20 Amazon leveler the day after the new standard tamper arrived just to see how things went. Very happy removing something from the workflow.   I still see the merit in products like The Force tamper if I were to get another calibrated tamper it would likely be that one but seem to enjoy the process of manually tamping a bit more and the results work well for me.

i4t7huh,2022-04-15 02:02:20,mohragk,u43lzd,A Question from the Masters!,Look up how to dial in espresso.  Espresso is about flow. You grind the coffee to a specific fineness to increase or decrease flow.  Typically you want a 1:2 ratio in around 30-35 seconds. So if you put in 16 grams of coffee you stop brewing when the liquid in the cup weighs 32 grams. The time it took should be around 30 to 35 grams.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u43lzd/a_question_from_the_masters/i4t7huh/'

I was so nervous when my machine came because while they‚Äôre shipped on a pallet they told me they couldn‚Äôt guarantee true delivery company would keep it on the pallet (they did).  I‚Äôd be interested in the resolution but open box is open box. Unless someone‚Äôs running hard chemicals the machines isn‚Äôt getting ruined in an open box window. It‚Äôs normal for a machines that‚Äôs been tested to have some water or other. And flashing error code can literally mean anything. My new machine was a frustrating experience: I couldn‚Äôt get the pump primes and we endedup having to do it with a large syringe. I was beyond annoyed. But the retailer (IDC in Canada) was super responsive and offered great support. That‚Äôs really what matters. I‚Äôm sure Clive will assist you and you should really update this or follow up they do.

It can be used to dynamically control the amount of water pumped against the puck to correct for channels or imitate lever machines for example.,i4ssxg0,/r/espresso/comments/u3yw6c/similar_machines_to_decent_espresso_or_mods_that/i4sxdky/'

Do you really want to spend money on a machine and then have to spend more money modding it and also spending time learning how to mod? Isnt it the case you just want to buy a machine and a grinder and get straight to making some good espresso?

The Gaggia uses a 58 mm portafilter and can be modded to make it better and better. You can check my profile to see the mods Ive done.

Great suggestion a bambino and a niche wil be an awesome first setup! I want to give you 2 other options:  First: the option that has been brought op and the route I have chosen: A gaggia and a DF64. Great combo which if you are open to modding just like me has ALOT of potential. A bambino and niche though is out of the box better than a stock gaggia and stock DF64 IMO.   Second: in EU the Lelit Glenda PL41PLUS T is 650 bucks. Has a PID and 58mm portafilter. Spend the rest on a Eureka series grinder like the Crono Manuale or Silenzio. I think that this is the best and most underated option if you just want everything to work straight out of the gate and have an amazing espresso experience.

A single boiler machine is slow and annoying to make more than a couple of milk based drinks at a time.  Also 58mm baskets are standard in better categories of machine so itd be nice to not end up with a bunch of 52mm accessories (or have trouble finding them) - BUT personally I would priorities a great grinder (like the Niche) over that if your only option is to buy a slightly more expensive but still entry level 58mm basket machine and have to comprise to a mediocre grinder.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3yu7z/help_a_newbie_sift_through_bad_advice_and_get_a/i4sysrh/'

i4tn3i6,2022-04-15 05:15:49,varro-reatinus,u3xrdx,Bambino Plus - waste of a Niche Zero?,A Niche is a fabulous first grinder.

No.  > Is it worth just getting over the intimidation and diving into the gaggia classic pro?  Yes.  The GCP shouldnt intimidate anyone. Its just a semi-auto.

i4u2zjf,2022-04-15 07:26:36,ChefKakashi,u3x25q,After over a month of waiting it finally got delivered ü•≤,Love it. Its the only one I use and it works really well. I get a consistent tamp every single time and theres one less variable to worry about. The one issue I have sometimes is that some bits of coffee get ripped off the coffee bed when I pull the tamper off after tamping. Ive resolved it by doing a spinning motion while the tamper is still in contact with the coffee bed. Also when you buy it make sure youre getting the V4 and not the older V3 our V2 models. The operation is different on those tampers I believe.,i4u1umz,/r/espresso/comments/u3x25q/after_over_a_month_of_waiting_it_finally_got/i4u2zjf/'

i4rhu5l,2022-04-14 16:02:12,elemental001,u3spkk,i make this video training with soap its okay? the sound and how i hold the pincher and rotation thanks,Few small suggestions:  1. Crank that steam to max right away its a little hard to tell from the video angle if youre doing it already. 2. That chirping sound is correct the sound of injecting air. But dont do it for the entire steaming session. Stop injecting air when the pitcher is about your body temperature (when its neutral feeling on your hand). Air added after that wont incorporate well. When you want to stop raise the pitcher a tiny bit to bury the steam wand but keep that whirlpool going. How much air to inject is up to you (and takes a bit of practice to get consistent too).,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3spkk/i_make_this_video_training_with_soap_its_okay_the/i4rhu5l/'

i4rz7ez,2022-04-14 18:15:30,Nick_pj,u3spkk,i make this video training with soap its okay? the sound and how i hold the pincher and rotation thanks,I think the major issue is the position of the wand in the pitcher. If you haven‚Äôt done so already watch [James Hoffman‚Äôs](https://youtu.be/oaKRBBpA4fw) and [Chris Baca‚Äôs](https://youtu.be/6YMgB61WyvE) tutorials. Tip of the steam wand should be **halfway** from front to back and **one third** of the way left to right. You can tilt the pitcher slightly to one side but don‚Äôt tilt it forward or backward. Establish the position of the pitcher and resist the urge to move it around a lot.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3spkk/i_make_this_video_training_with_soap_its_okay_the/i4rz7ez/'

i4sdfrz,2022-04-14 20:09:36,Possession_Loud,u3spkk,i make this video training with soap its okay? the sound and how i hold the pincher and rotation thanks,Ill add that you are definitely too close to the walls of the pitcher that is why you hear that metallic noise. Your milk needs room to move and you dont want the steam coming out of the nozzle to hit the pitcher at any time. Being SLIGHTLY off center and tilted is the way. Also i cant quite tell but you might have overfilled your pitcher too. You want to stay just under the bottom corner of the spout. This way you are sure you got all the room for your liquid to grow and you can comfortably tilt the pitcher knowing nothing will splash out.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3spkk/i_make_this_video_training_with_soap_its_okay_the/i4sdfrz/'

i4r9wnk,2022-04-14 15:04:34,iwanttohugallthecats,u3s835,whats the problem with my foam im new in this work i have 3 days working,I cant comment on your air pressure.   I get the best results when I start with the nozzle about 1cm under the milk surface.   Then I start slowly decreasing this distance until I can hear a tss tss ~ which is the point you are introducing air into the milk.   You want to find this spot as fast as possible so that you have the most time possible to introduce air but also being gentile about it. The purpose of 1cm to me at this stage is just to not create air bubbles until I have found the right spot. Not that it is a magic number or anything.   By gentile I mean raise the nozzle barely above the surface less often creating small bubbles. As opposed to leaving it above the surface creating big bubbles.  I dont focus on swirling until the bottom of the jug is the temperature of my hand.   Swirling breaks down the bubbles into smaller ones. Being more gentile and starting with smaller bubbles I think will create a micro foam with higher bubble density.   Obviously dont make bubbles while you are swirling since your goal here is to make the bubbles you just made smaller. Your goal here is to make the milk swirl as fast as you can consistently until the milk reaches the desired drink temp.  This is another depth and location that you want to find as fast as possible.   You can also tap the jug on the counter a couple times to try and pop bubbles.  People who are very good can make small enough bubbles to where they dont have to tap the jug on the counter.,i4r8tma,/r/espresso/comments/u3s835/whats_the_problem_with_my_foam_im_new_in_this/i4r9wnk/'

Ultimately went with the Quick Mill. It has an actual boiler for the group head not thermoblock like the Ascaso but it also has a separate thermoblock heating element for the steam. I think we preferred the Ascaso for aesthetics but the Quick Mill won out for utility. One thing that the Ascaso has that the Quick Mill doesn‚Äôt is that it has programmable pre-infusion. It only allows you to do this for up to 5 seconds which is kind of short but the Quick Mill doesn‚Äôt have pre-infusion at all without modding it.   All that being said I think the Ascaso Dream will be a satisfying upgrade for you if it‚Äôs something you want can afford and have access to.

i4t78ca,2022-04-15 01:58:29,coffeebikepop,u3oodg,Simple Questions Thread,uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh. You cant reuse coffee.  Most of the solubles you want in coffee (including caffeine which is very water-soluble) are going out during the first pull. There is probably NOTHING good in the subsequent pulls youre making.  I recommend you taste the second shot on its own and then make a decision on whether you want to add that foul-tasting solution to your shot.  What you could try instead if you want a taller drink is to just dilute it with water - make an americano. It will taste like the first shot but with less strength and body.,i4t5ptg,/r/espresso/comments/u3oodg/simple_questions_thread/i4t78ca/'
i4tgjqq,2022-04-15 04:05:01,Guy_Perish,u3oodg,Simple Questions Thread,There‚Äôs a concept called extraction. Caffeine is one of the most soluble molecules in coffee so we would predict the vast majority to be extracted in the first shot if the amount of water through the first shot was enough to properly extract the coffee. Subsequent pulls will extract more bitter fibrous materials which taste bad. If there was too much coffee in the first basket and not enough water flowing through pulling a second time can improve the taste and increase caffeine content but this is not how we typically describe how espresso is made. There shouldn‚Äôt be any reason to do a second extraction as we always dial in coffee to be fully extracted on the first pull. Some budget friendly machines may not allow for this flexibility so doing wonky things like pressing the button multiple times may be warranted.,i4t5ptg,/r/espresso/comments/u3oodg/simple_questions_thread/i4tgjqq/'

Step back a bit until you are hitting your desired extraction time. A good starting point is a 1:2 ratio extracted in about 30 seconds.

i4vk30y,2022-04-15 13:33:19,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u3oodg,Simple Questions Thread,The Barista Express is in your price range but it is not easy to use. You need to experiment with amount of ground coffee amount of water and grind size to get the best tasting espresso.   Although super-automatic machines are not liked in this sub one might be the right choice for your MIL. The espresso wont taste as good but making it will be much easier - just press a button. I used to own a DeLonghi Magnifica S which [Amazon has on sale for ¬£365](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DeLonghi-Automatic-Coffee-Machine-ECAM22-110-B/dp/B00400OMU0/).  If your MIL really wants to get into home espresso as a hobby then there are much better choices than the Barista Express. While the BE has a good brewer its grinder is poor. Its much better to get a separate espresso machine and grinder.

i4rwjh7,2022-04-14 17:54:30,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u3oodg,Simple Questions Thread,Your first step should be to clean and calibrate your Rocky. You are going to have to grind finer.  Sour means your shot was under-extracted. You are going to have to extract more not less. Easiest way to do that is to increase your dose:yield ratio. 21g is a large dose that your machine might be having trouble fully extracting. So instead of increasing the yield I suggest you decrease the dose. A smaller dose will make your shot run faster so you are going to have to grind finer to get a good extraction time.  Check out the [Espresso Compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-espresso-compass/) for more info. On the Compasss page read the posts on espresso Dose Yield Time prior to watching the video ‚ÄòPutting it All Together‚Äô.

i4u9kpr,2022-04-15 08:13:08,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u3oodg,Simple Questions Thread,Yes this is normal. The 16g dose slows down the water flow due to increased thickness of the puck that increases its water resistance. The increased time that the coffee is in contact with water results in over-extraction which tastes bitter.

i4tjzd9,2022-04-15 04:43:49,cnkight,u3oodg,Simple Questions Thread,I typically do the 5 shots and add water to it so I will try the regular Americano. I like a pretty strong drink though so I might also try emptying out the portafilter between shots and putting fresh grounds in before pulling another shot. Probably goes without saying but Im definitely no espresso expert.   Just because Im curious though I will try tasting each shot on its own to see how poor they taste when I do it my way. lol Appreciate the feedback - truly helpful. :),i4t78ca,/r/espresso/comments/u3oodg/simple_questions_thread/i4tjzd9/'

But since for now Im alone and I drink just 2 espresso per day I wouldnt go that far spending 1000‚Ç¨ for a dual-bolier that whould stay most of the time shut-down. In the future Im sure I will consider her more but at that time while spending 1000‚Ç¨ for the machine I guess 100‚Ç¨ more are not a problem for new 58mm accessories. For the 57mm I was considering same as you: Funnel Basket Tamper WDT e puck-screen to keep group-clean... but my question is are the 480‚Ç¨ for the Lelit grace justified istead of 199‚Ç¨ of the Bambino just for 2 espresso/day?

i4vg59k,2022-04-15 13:05:03,Gimminy,u3oodg,Simple Questions Thread,It is designed to use coarser grinds then. It will actually preform worse if you are grinding as fine as you would need to if using a non-pressurized basket. Nothing wrong with that as a beginner setup. Good luck on your journey! Just remember you can get good espresso on a relatively budget setup. No need to spend 6k on a machine and 3k on a grinder. If you want to improve your setup start with a decent grinder and a non-pressurized basket and go from there.

At worst youll get a bad shot at best you have less waste and can sometimes learn something. Dont take it all so seriously this is supposed to be fun and trying new things is part of that.

Most important accessory in achieving great extraction! My girlfriend gets upset with me in the mornings because I say this tool changed my life.,You are right! I used to grind and then use the OCD(one of those spin things) tool and then tamp. More often than not I had channeling and uneven extractions. Then I implemented a wdt that had 3 sticks but were to thick and did not work. When I switched to a proper wdt with thin needles it changed my extraction and channeling disappeared even though I was extracting at 14 bars at the moment. So it is definitely not overhyped.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3nljo/a_few_months_ago_i_was_having_some_issues_with/i4qjkag/'

i4q9gfi,2022-04-14 10:59:18,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u3mrn8,Breville Upgraded me from a Bambino Plus to the Barista Express is this really an upgrade?,If you are serious about espresso you need to learn how to steam milk without the auto-frother since most better machines that you eventually upgrade to wont have one. The BE has better build quality than the Bambino and it also has (albeit very limited) temperature control. Its grinder is similar to the SGP but my understanding is that the SGP is a slightly better grinder.  If you have the room I would advise you to keep the BE and start watching Lance Hedricks latte art videos.  If you dont have the room a possible option would be to downgrade to a non-Plus Bambino and ask for a refund of the price difference.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3mrn8/breville_upgraded_me_from_a_bambino_plus_to_the/i4q9gfi/'
i4qm0hn,2022-04-14 12:22:32,OuchyS,u3mrn8,Breville Upgraded me from a Bambino Plus to the Barista Express is this really an upgrade?,If you still have your smart grinder use that over the built in grinder most people dont use the one thats built into the BE. The one thing I would watch for is that the Bambino Plus is set to 9 bars from factory where as the BE is set to something like 15 bars... Its very easy to change however I completely understand not wanting to change it as you have to get inside the machine to do so. The other option is to pull your shots in pre-infusion only mode.  Personally I think it is worthwhile learning how to steam milk it will expand your horizons for potential machines in the future and add another skill set to your arsenal.   This isnt so much of an upgrade as more of a side shift theyve still given you something capable that can make good drinks its just a little different in what it offers.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3mrn8/breville_upgraded_me_from_a_bambino_plus_to_the/i4qm0hn/'

i4q439w,2022-04-14 10:24:25,Ben_V_Prank,u3mlgr,Two weeks with the Ascaso Steel PID,I recently got an Ascaso Steel Uno PID and used it daily for about two weeks and since there are very few reviews I could find I though it would be helpful to do a small one here.        First some background: I used to have a Breville/Sage Bambino plus for roughly two years before that and I am using a Eureka Mignon Silenzio with medium roast beans. I also use a 18g VST basket.        Build quality:     This machine is well built compared to the Bambino (and rightfully so for the price). All steel panels look great the switches are really satisfying it‚Äôs easy to use and everything feels solid. Just a minor thing : the engraving on the water tank is pretty bad but I personally don‚Äôt care. The pump doesn‚Äôt make the best sound but it‚Äôs a non-issue to me either. I really like the barista lights around the group head it gives the machine a really cool look.        Workflow:    The quick heat up time of this machine is important to me and since it is a thermoblock in about 5min and a blank shot the whole thing is at the set temperature (in my case 94¬∞C). The temperature is VERY consistent shot to shot (according to Kaffee Macher on YT) and the machine has been very consistent in my experience. The portafilter is great and the volumetrics are consistent if you keep the same grind setting. The transition to steaming is quick by the time I cleaned the portafilter and filled the milk pitcher it is ready to go. I am not a big fan of the shape of the steam wand but it is workable. I would recommend changing the included tamper the shape is very awkward to use. The adjustable OPV is easy to set with a basic screwdriver next to the (heated) group head I set it to 9 bars. The cup warmer gets very hot quite quickly but I would recommend using some kind of mat to put the cups on if you want to use it.         Overall I can only recommend this machine if you want a fast heating very consistent and enjoyable to use machine. The looks are subjective but I think it looks better than most E61 machines and machines in the same price range all together. I can‚Äôt speak on reliability yet but for now I see no problem.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3mlgr/two_weeks_with_the_ascaso_steel_pid/i4q439w/'
i4qf06c,2022-04-14 11:36:19,thatdudenick,u3mlgr,Two weeks with the Ascaso Steel PID,I really like the look of these machines.  The metal switches remind me of the switches on a vintage stereo system,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3mlgr/two_weeks_with_the_ascaso_steel_pid/i4qf06c/'
i4r2bzn,2022-04-14 14:10:33,ogdankmaster840,u3mlgr,Two weeks with the Ascaso Steel PID,I love mine. The switches are incredibly satisfying. My biggest complaints mainly come down to the steaming and cup warming tray. Why is it slanted? I wish it was just level. The pump does make a pretty bad noise when it encounters a bit of resistance. The steam wand like you said could be better. Its only happened 3 times in around 5 months but the steam has cut out on me. No sure what happened but its cut off about 10 seconds into steaming. Or has fizzled out before my milk was even warn. Not a huge issue but it has happened. The duo probably fixes the steam problems,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3mlgr/two_weeks_with_the_ascaso_steel_pid/i4r2bzn/'

i50pfj2,2022-04-16 16:45:38,boardonfire,u3mlgr,Two weeks with the Ascaso Steel PID,Thx for the good review!  I bought the duo pid about 7 month ago awesome machine! I love it!  My coffe is super consistent i use around 18grams and set it up to  45g liquid in 35sec with 3sec preinfusion. Thats 6sec before the extraction begins. So the actual extraction time is 29sec.  There is just one thing i dont understand: the opv is set to around 12bar which is alot. With this setup im sometimes hitting the 12bar which causes the volumetrics to screw up because the sensor sits before the pump so it also counts the water that is running through the opv.  How is it possible to go so low with the opv and still getting that extraction time? Or do u always trigger the obv?,i4q439w,/r/espresso/comments/u3mlgr/two_weeks_with_the_ascaso_steel_pid/i50pfj2/'

i4slq7t,2022-04-14 21:25:50,Ben_V_Prank,u3mlgr,Two weeks with the Ascaso Steel PID,No problem! I was also a bit confused by that   If you use a ~18g basket it already is a double shot but every one uses that as one espresso. You basically split a normal 18g in 36g out into two cups so as you said it makes two single shot. If you want two espresso for two people you will need to do the 18g shot twice since I dont think a 36g basket exists and you would need to dial it in every time you want to use it.

Finding a coffee shop that is devoted to the craft is difficult. I live in Palm Beach County and I can only think of two places that serve good espresso and one of those places was operating out of an airstream. The city forced them to go brick and mortar and unfortunately the quality took a dive.   So across the largest county in the country there is only one truly great coffee shop (and I have been to nearly all of them).

Fresher beans are going to have a lot more volatiles and CO2 than old supermarket beans.  All that stuff goes in to the water and increases viscosity which is resistance to flow.

i4p6sf3,2022-04-14 06:42:40,vickeryj,u3hjqb,Is a triple shot more caffeine than french press?,Caffeine in coffee is very soluable so if your coffee doesn‚Äôt taste underextracted you‚Äôve likely extracted all the caffeine that you will no matter the brewing method. So in your example using the same beans you should have more caffeine from 26g of French press than 21g of espresso.  This doesn‚Äôt mean that it will impact you in the same way. The espresso is more concentrated as you say so you will be getting the caffeine faster which can have an impact on how you respond to it.  If you want to experiment on yourself you could try diluting your espresso with water to make an americano.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3hjqb/is_a_triple_shot_more_caffeine_than_french_press/i4p6sf3/'
i4p5y6t,2022-04-14 06:36:24,rhodium32,u3hjqb,Is a triple shot more caffeine than french press?,Youre confusing concentration with content. Concentration is content divided by volume - mg caffeine / mL of beverage for example. Content is the just the amount of the substance of interest. Yes espresso is more concentrated in caffeine than regular brewed coffee is. Thats because it has a lot of caffeine in a relatively small volume. Big number divided by small number equals a big number. That however is not what your first sentence asks. That question is about content - more caffeine. While espresso has a higher concentration of caffeine primarily due to its very small volume a cup of brewed coffee made with the same mass of the same coffee beans will generally have higher caffeine content. So given the fact that your French press recipe calls of a larger mass of beans (26g/cup vs 21g/cup) and the fact that most brew methods are slightly more effective at extracting the caffeine from the grounds your cup of French press coffee likely contains more caffeine that the triple shot of espresso - albeit at lower concentration.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3hjqb/is_a_triple_shot_more_caffeine_than_french_press/i4p5y6t/'

i4qsf3j,2022-04-14 13:04:47,filthysven,u3hjqb,Is a triple shot more caffeine than french press?,Youve read just enough about espresso to be confidently wrong. A traditional single shot of espresso is 7g so a double was 14 and a triple 21. That is what old school Italian espresso is served as. In modern coffee people stopped using those old styles partially because people gravitate towards the easier to pull 14-18g baskets and partially because modern weight based espresso made shot count a largely useless number. In the end modern espresso is almost always described as a double shot unless its wildly out of bounds (7g or close to 30g). You can easily find cafes serving anything from 14-22g of coffee as doubles but most are around 18g. Its just easier to describe things as doubles because people are used to it.  So all that to say you can call most things doubles and be right. There are amounts that person to person are considered both doubles and triples. Its almost never wrong to call anything 20g+ a triple. Its not a well defined term anymore. The only way you can really go wrong is telling someone that they are incorrect about such a fuzzy concept which is exactly what you did.,i4piskw,/r/espresso/comments/u3hjqb/is_a_triple_shot_more_caffeine_than_french_press/i4qsf3j/'

I have to do the same thing with the Lunars at the shop I work at.   Remember though that timing is done for consistency and as long as you do the same thing every time thats all that matters. So perhaps you could use it and just know that for a given coffee the first drops happen 6 seconds after the pump engages - in that case youd aim for 20-25 seconds on your timer which is fine.,i4po6eb,/r/espresso/comments/u3g67d/what_scale_would_you_recommend_to_time_a_shot_and/i4q1v33/'

Regardless of whether your ideal shot winds up being 30s or 45s or what have you the dial in should go by taste not time. So go ahead and let the scale timer go at first drop so long as it always does so it wont affect anything,i4po6eb,/r/espresso/comments/u3g67d/what_scale_would_you_recommend_to_time_a_shot_and/i4vgr3k/'

i4oqjo2,2022-04-14 04:20:57,SirClaks,u3cmze,Bought a second hand Barista Express and the water is spraying out using pressurised basket (waiting on delivery of a different basket). Happens with an empty basket as well as a very coarse pre-ground coffe and a finer moka-sized pre-ground coffee,Check the bottom of the pressurised basket is the hole in the middle or slightly offset?  On pressurised baskets all of the water is coming out of a single hole so even at a relatively low flow rate it comes out fast. If youve ever put your finger over the end of a garden hose the basket has a similar effect. If the hole is in the middle of the basket then the stream of water sprays directly onto the middle of the double spout and can cause this. The pressurised basket for the express should be slightly offset so that the stream hits the bottom of the portafilter and then flows a little more normally out the double spout.  I believe the Bambino version of the pressurised basket has the hole in the center because it has a different portafilter design so you may have that version.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3cmze/bought_a_second_hand_barista_express_and_the/i4oqjo2/'

Roast level = medium  also want to add that I changed my grind settings as I kept it around 21 clicks (10.5) which I used for my flair but thought this might be too coarse. Im wondering now if its too fine and theres channelling problems (especially with the lack of a good tamper).  Also Im used to having a pressure gauge with my flair so I could determine a problem straight away but I feel like Im doing this blind.,i4od2qk,/r/espresso/comments/u3cgxe/la_pavoni_for_dummies_i_need_some_advice_to_get/i4odbvc/'
i4ssbki,2022-04-14 22:38:38,myglock9mm,u3cgxe,La Pavoni for dummies : I need some advice to get started,I have a premil which has some differences but that said some questions:  1) Whats the temperature of your group when you pull your shot? 2) Whats the pressure in the boiler when you pull your shot?  Pulling too hot will lead to bitter shots but you have to know the temperature of the machine (group) and the temperature of the water in the boiler - via knowing the boilers pressure - to estimate the temperature of the water hitting the puck.  If you dont already have one when you order a real tamper Id pick up some stick-on temperature strips and slap them on the group.  Also regarding air in the machine yes - you typically do need to purge. Once the boiler comes up to pressure you can try the following:  *) Using a cup of water and submerge the tip of the steam wand. Open the steam valve and youll see bubbles of air escape.  *) Leave the steam valve open and submerged in your cup of water and slowly raise the lever. You might see more bubbles escape the steam wand as youre pushing trapped air out of the group.  Note: you dont need a cup of water to purge the machine but its useful the first few times to get visual feedback until youve got a feel for the process.  While a Pavoni will never be the machine to use if spro-overs are your thing if your machine is purged of air you should be able to easily get north of 30 grams of output without a Fellini.,i4odbvc,/r/espresso/comments/u3cgxe/la_pavoni_for_dummies_i_need_some_advice_to_get/i4ssbki/'

I tried the water technique and think I wasnt bleeding off the excess pressure as much as I should have. Ive also got more confident in flushing water out and making sure everything is hot.

This requires quite a lot of force but it does work. It‚Äôs an excellent clean and transparent grinder. I think the bigger flat burrs really shine. I haven‚Äôt used the k10 but cleaning a chute between shots seems like a nightmare. I imagine anyone who takes reasonable care of their equipment probably knows that the retention from cleaning is not the same as the kind of retention that requires purging and process between shots. So yeah I‚Äôm sure there are grounds in there but shot to shot I‚Äôm not seeing significant need to purge or any extra faff.

I felt the Compak was a big step up from the SJ as far as how good the shots tasted and how easy it was to dial in shots and make small adjustments. The Compak is a pain for single dosing- I can sure relate to that but the shots were excellent and accuracy of adjusting the grind setting is also great. Never had the Atom so cant compare but like the others suggested- dont get rid of the Compak.

Twice I reported that it was working properly again but each time the good results only lasted a couple days. I got the Niche because I read all the great reviews as well but the one I got- compared to the K10 its not even close. The workflow is obviously a lot easier and if you get one that isnt defective like mine then the difference in quality is probably very small. 68 vs 64mm conical burrs. Build quality-wise the K10 is a sturdy beast and the Niche is mostly plastic so longevity could be an issue.

i4oepnw,2022-04-14 01:48:37,SnS_Carmine,u3b9hu,Why before WDT tool my coffee weighs 0.2/0.3 grams more?,The difference will be due to pressure compressing the air creating two different atmospheres (inside the balloon vs outside the balloon) making the air in the balloon *minus* the volume of air displaced by its size to be different from 0.  Anyway this is talking about a balloon that you would be significantly inflated compared to whatever air is trapped in-between grounds. Plus the fact that there is no compression of air so no pressure differential.

i4p5imd,2022-04-14 06:33:08,KCcoffeegeek,u3ax2g,How to time shots?,The correct/standard way is to start the time when you start the pump. Water is making contact with coffee at this point so extraction is occurring. So if the recipe is 18g in 35 out in 29 seconds then it should be expected that the 29 seconds is the time from turning the pump on to when you turn it off to end the shot. The other common way to time shots is to start the time at first drip as some scales do it this way.   In reality though this is really only an issue if youre sharing recipes with others and the standard really ought to be to specify how youre timing. If youre only timing your own shots out of interest consistency or following a recipe you like then it doesnt really matter since you know how you are doing your timing.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3ax2g/how_to_time_shots/i4p5imd/'

If you‚Äôre aiming at a 25 sec shot then use the integrated shot timer. It‚Äôs standard on most commercial machines for the pump to engage in about 7 seconds but before that the puck is hit with line pressure and we definitely count that toward extraction time. On consumer machines the pump typically starts right away and you shouldn‚Äôt worry about first drips just overall extraction time.

That doesnt necessarily mean its also the best method. Since its about contact time it would be best to start as soon as the water hits the puck.  Since this is not an easy reference point starting at button press or at the first drop both are equally decent alternatives. I prefer the first drop because depending on how long the machine has been idle the delay between hitting start and seeing the pressure rise may differ a bit. I dont believe it really is an issue but since you have to choose something I went for first drop,i4otuwf,/r/espresso/comments/u3ax2g/how_to_time_shots/i4oy0ab/'

What happened to me was the ears on the portafilter wore down over time and diminished the seal clamping force even though it was turned all the way in.   One possible way of counter-acting it is to get a new basket w/ thicker rim but thats a just a hacky workaround.   Finally I found some portafilter shims for 25c a pop on the internet.

i4pyshk,2022-04-14 09:49:43,madaeko,u3adq9,Good and sweater shots with 11 bars of pressure,Higher pressures are more deleterious on achieving even extraction than pressures at/below 9 bars. As such make sure your grinder is great and your puck prep game is on point if you‚Äôre going to be sticking to these pressures.   I used to have a machine that would push pressures above 9 bars. When I finally worked up the courage to adjust the OPV many struggles I was having with channeling finally went away. That‚Äôs obviously just my anecdote. There exist however plenty of compelling data supporting better more consistent shots when limiting pressure to 9 bars. Anyone who says otherwise should be asked for data supporting their statements because they‚Äôre objective refuted. The best advice I can give you is to adjust your OPV!,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3adq9/good_and_sweater_shots_with_11_bars_of_pressure/i4pyshk/'

I wrote directly to Lelit and they advised me to contact the local reseller but im sure that the local reseller would love to say that it would void the warranty.   It is a strange situation.

Then I spoke to Lelit who said actual pressure is a bit lower than what shown on the gauge and that to achieve my favourite notes it would be better to leave it with factory settings so I trusted them and adjusted it back to 11/12 bars.,i4ocwmv,/r/espresso/comments/u3adq9/good_and_sweater_shots_with_11_bars_of_pressure/i4ofi8d/'
i4ovj07,2022-04-14 05:10:42,tommyhateseveryone,u3adq9,Good and sweater shots with 11 bars of pressure,Don‚Äôt listen to WLL. I think dealers for these machines that aren‚Äôt as well versed in modern espresso subscribe to this old way of thinking that the puck should only provide 9 bars of resistance. That isn‚Äôt true your pump should be giving you 9 bars as a max and the resistance of your puck should determine shot time. I doubt they would consider this something that would void a warranty. That‚Äôs like saying adjusting the action on a guitar voids the warranty that‚Äôs pretty absurd. They would also not know you opened it and it‚Äôs unlikely the tech working on it would even care if they noticed.,i4ocwmv,/r/espresso/comments/u3adq9/good_and_sweater_shots_with_11_bars_of_pressure/i4ovj07/'
i4p50hf,2022-04-14 06:29:15,itisnotstupid,u3adq9,Good and sweater shots with 11 bars of pressure,I mean on one hand you have a glued tube and a screw that from what ive heard is pretty soft and easy to to notice that it was unscrewed so I guess a good technician would easily spot that something was changed. Especially when this change means ungluing a tube.   As for the idea of 9 bars vs higher. I have limited experience but from what I see the pressure always goes around/above 11 bars which would mean that even if the PID is one bar wrong...the pressure in the puck would be at least 10 bars.,i4ovj07,/r/espresso/comments/u3adq9/good_and_sweater_shots_with_11_bars_of_pressure/i4p50hf/'

i4npm3d,2022-04-13 20:46:45,c0s9,u381pj,Trying to decide on a grinder for espresso,I got a Crono from Seattle Coffee Gear a few weeks ago on sale for $209. It actually had the espresso burrs installed (new old stock. 2020 production date.) my understanding from doing research before I bought is that aside from the timer function the Crono is identical mechanically to the notte. Same 50mm burrs (assuming you get espresso burrs) same motor same dosing mechanism same stepless adjustment etc. I grind directly into a portafilter and I never cared about forks. So of those are your options for the Mignon line unless you‚Äôre going with a specialita or silenzio then the only difference is manual grind vs timed. I say go with whatever you get the best price on personally.     As far as the DF64 goes I have no experience there. the burrs are an upgrade and it looks like once properly seasoned it probably has less retention so it‚Äôs totally up to you if that‚Äôs your jam for the money  Edit: [here‚Äôs the post I saw about Crono with espresso burrs vs notte ](https://www.home-barista.com/grinders/eureka-notte-vs-crono-t73736.html),-,/r/espresso/comments/u381pj/trying_to_decide_on_a_grinder_for_espresso/i4npm3d/'

After you pre-mix your concentrates and then add them to your distilled water youre only adding like a few milligrams per gallon of stuff. With the freezing thats just gotta be a coincidence. Theres not really any substance out there that that raises the freezing point of water.  These sorts of extremely detailed water recipes are mostly for taste and extraction theyre not really necessary for the health of your espresso machine. In fact I dont know about the particular one you linked but a lot of times the various optimal coffee water recipes are more for pour overs and harder than the warranty specs for most espresso machines. Its sort of a trade off because in general more minerals (to a point) are better for coffee extraction but fewer minerals (to a point) are better for the health of espresso machines. I think in general though youd usually be hard pressed to tell the difference so long as youre using water in generally soft range.  So yeah Id say just use bottled water. Though be careful you want just normal drinking water not mineral water like Evian. Ideally you want some that lists the hardness either on the bottle or online somewhere. You want the hardness to be basically between 1 and 3 gpg (or about 20-50 mg/L Evian lists theirs as 291 mg/L so thats no good for espresso machines.) None of the other water specs are really all that important at least in terms of machine health.  You should also probably try to flush out as much of your failed science project water out as you can Id probably use distilled water for that and flush a few liters through the group and out the hot water tap if it has one.

I‚Äôm fairly certain you can lower the freezing point of water by adding things but I don‚Äôt think you can make it higher  Maybe you failed to close it completely causing it to run all night trying to cool itself down. The new cold air would run down to the bottom and the warm air would rise probably passing the thermostat on the way and convincing the fridge that it still wasn‚Äôt cold enough so it kept running.

You created two concentrates into two separate 1L bottles? One buffer concentrate and one hardness concentrate? And then you added 185g of buffer concentrate to 1 gallon of water? And 63g of hardness concentrate to that same gallon of water?  I might be wrong here but using a calculator it looks like this recipe from WLL gives 67GH/38KH which isnt bad by any means.  That said I recommend either direct dosing (if your scale allows) or making 10000ppm concentrates per the espressoaf guide.  10000 ppm concentrates allow you to add 1g concentrate to 1L for 10 points. i.e. 67GH can be achieved with 6.7g of concentrate.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u3819l/coffee_water_fail_what_happened_and_what_next/i4r9a0v/'

Volumetrically I actually put in what appeared to be slightly less than the videos - I used the same sizes of measuring spoons to hold the ingredients and compared it to the videos to be sure and my spoons were less full than what was shown in the videos despite having the correct weights.   >These sorts of extremely detailed water recipes are mostly for taste and extraction theyre not really necessary for the health of your espresso machine  WLL specifically advertised this as a low-scale water recipe to extend the life of espresso machines.

I dont think coincidental double fridge failure that only affected my coffee water among 5 different jugs and bottles is the answer.  Everything in the fridge was fine and appropriately cold.

i4rc64u,2022-04-14 15:20:55,mattmonkey24,u3819l,Coffee water fail. What happened and what next?,> Its odd that the WLL recipe calls from 10.1g of magnesium sulfate/L for the hardness solution but this Barista Hustle recipe calls for 2.45g/L.  The BH recipes target 1000PPM for each solution. This allows you to add 1g of the concentrate to 1L of water for 1GH.  The WLL recipe creates 4100PPM Mg and 834PPM KH. Then youre kinda stuck using their recommended dilutions from there its not as easy to pick different recipes from there.,i4nqr47,/r/espresso/comments/u3819l/coffee_water_fail_what_happened_and_what_next/i4rc64u/'
i4p0p1b,2022-04-14 05:55:41,ayyysalute,u3819l,Coffee water fail. What happened and what next?,>Note that at the end of the Barista Hustle post they dont recommend using these recipes in an espresso machine.  I read that as well and was a little confused since WLL specifically advertises their recipe as a low-scale recipe to extend the life of espresso machines.  10.1g does seem really high maybe its just a bad recipe. I saw that BH released a corrected version of their ratios. But I think Im just going to test the hardness of my Berkey filtered water and go with that if its acceptable.,i4nqr47,/r/espresso/comments/u3819l/coffee_water_fail_what_happened_and_what_next/i4p0p1b/'

i4po7qh,2022-04-14 08:41:13,Bindlestiff4142,u3819l,Coffee water fail. What happened and what next?,Are you sure you didnt transpose a decimal point somewhere along the line or something? Youre adding roughly 25 milligrams (0.0025g) of baking soda and 60 milligrams (0.006 g) of epsom salt to a gallon (3800 g) of water. Its a miniscule concentration of stuff thats not particularly strong tasting. You shouldnt be able to taste it.  As for the recipe usually the espresso recipe is lower hardness than a typical coffee water recipe but still on the high end of what you want to be putting into your machine. I personally think unless youve got something specific youre trying to do extraction-wise by tweaking your water youre better off using generic soft water than risking screwing something up with an overly complicated water recipe.,i4p0asi,/r/espresso/comments/u3819l/coffee_water_fail_what_happened_and_what_next/i4po7qh/'

i4p2isb,2022-04-14 06:10:14,all_systems_failing,u3819l,Coffee water fail. What happened and what next?,I think Barista Hustles concern is the potential for these recipes to cause boiler corrosion.  I would start with manufacturer water quality recommendations then test my water. I wouldnt worry about it if its within recommended parameters.  The other option would be to use a bottled water (with known water quality) and re-miniralizing it.,i4p0p1b,/r/espresso/comments/u3819l/coffee_water_fail_what_happened_and_what_next/i4p2isb/'
i4puskf,2022-04-14 09:23:29,ayyysalute,u3819l,Coffee water fail. What happened and what next?,Anything is possible I guess but I dont see how I could have been off by an order of magnitude while still putting in volumetrically slightly less than what was shown in the video. I put less than a quarter teaspoon of baking soda in a liter by volume weighed it to the .1g and roughly twice that amount of epsom. Theres no way I could have added too much concentrate because the gallon would have overflowed since I only removed exactly as much from it as it said to put back in from the concentrates.  By taste I meant a *very* subtle difference in mineral flavor compared to spring water. Like anyone tasting it blind would probably think it was just water.  But people make mistakes. I guess the only way to know for sure is if I test the hardness - although from another commenter it sounds like 10g of epsom in the concentrate is really high which would explain the very faint salty taste.,i4po7qh,/r/espresso/comments/u3819l/coffee_water_fail_what_happened_and_what_next/i4puskf/'
i4p3ior,2022-04-14 06:18:05,ayyysalute,u3819l,Coffee water fail.

Original opv was an aluminum cylinder no adjustment possible cannot be opened. OPV strapped to the frame not directly on the pump.   The schematic showed the adjustable as being fitted to some machines (thus why I think you much newer oscar ii might have one). It fits directly to the pump and has a threaded nipple for the outlet hose to connect to.

i4obfne,2022-04-14 01:02:06,friendly_imposter,u37fl9,DIY Espresso Machine,what are the benefits you are looking for when going into pressure profiling?  i have a quite simmilar project running for a year on a rancilio silvia also with pressure profiling gravimetric dosing and heated brewhead.   my findings so far: slower pressure ramp up does cause less channeling so you can grind finer. preinfusion let the shot run faster so you can grind finer with heated brewhead and gravimetric dosing warmup is quite short (10-15 min for my silvia) and consistency is excelent! my drawdown time varies only a couple of seconds from shot to shot.  so light roasts benefit from pressure profiling but for medium to darker rosts (which i prefer as espresso light roasts go in the v60) it can get quite frustrating with all the extra parameters to play.   what are your (or decent users) thoughts on this?,-,/r/espresso/comments/u37fl9/diy_espresso_machine/i4obfne/'

The whole system circulates water with less than 500ml of total volume so it can preheat quite fast. When the line valve closes the water between the pump and grouphead pressurizes so you can make espresso.

Im more accustomed to electronics / cars.  For an ECU a closed loop will set the injectors on a cars intake by using the signal from the O2 sensor.    Is that the kind of closed loop system youre talking about?  Where a sensor tells you how much is in the boiler?    Or is there some other hydraulic closed loop system that Im unaware of which youre talking about?  Im a bit stuck at the part of how a boiler fills up from dry.

i4pyf7d,2022-04-14 09:47:17,Tahusan,u37fl9,DIY Espresso Machine,A coffee machine can‚Äôt be compared to a car same terms can mean totally different things. Think of it if a more plumbing machine.   We need more pictures to understand the connections fully but from the screen it is obvious there is no sensor for water level. I will try to explain what I understood from OP hopefully am close enough.   As for the boiler it is acting like water heater at home. An external tank that is attached to the wall is what has to be filled (level is known by observation). The boiler in this case the OP said is closed loop water ‚Äúheater‚Äù is always full as you don‚Äôt have a pump to fill the boiler and another pump to make your shot. The tank and boiler are connected directly that when water is pumped from the heater the negative pressure itself will fill it back from the tank. You can see the direct connection.   What you are worried about is if both tank and boiler and empty which may lead to overheating of the system. But the transparent hose should make it easy to know the time of filling even before by checking the tank daily.   The closed loop in plumbing terms means that there‚Äôs recirculating water in a closed loop between the boiler and a heat source this water does not mix with the water inside the boiler. But in this small scale I wonder how constant is the temperature during shot pulling.  Edit:  From what OP described the closed loop here is different. The loop is circulating the water form the boiler itself to a heating element inside the group head (external heat element). Since the pressure on the portafilter is high the water goes back to the boiler and thus a closed loop is present. Until the temperature indicated is reach a valve closes the loop thus the only way out is through the filter down to your cup. The presence of the heating element inside the group head should increase the accuracy of temperature of the water pulled. Tough again how many temperature sensors is OP using and where are they placed.,i4paqsl,/r/espresso/comments/u37fl9/diy_espresso_machine/i4pyf7d/'

i4qf8l2,2022-04-14 11:37:52,iperrin17,u37fl9,DIY Espresso Machine,Yup pretty close. The key part is that the boiler is at ambient pressure which allows for the refill using negative pressure (no steam wand though). For heating elements there are actually 2x - one in the grouphead to control grouphead temperature and one in the boiler to control the water temp. Together they offer quite a bit of control and preheat quickly. The water temp drops slightly during a shot although thats really just in the boiler as the amount of water used during a shot mostly comes from the lines and the thermal mass of the grouphead holds a lot of temperature stability.,i4pyf7d,/r/espresso/comments/u37fl9/diy_espresso_machine/i4qf8l2/'

i4qmr8t,2022-04-14 12:27:25,Tahusan,u37fl9,DIY Espresso Machine,I am totally in love with this masterpiece you built. I wanted to do one my self and I am delaying it as much until I get pro at pulling espresso. But this is a great reference to to start with.   A steam wand would need another boiler which practically means another machine. If you have an old espresso machine you can as well use it as a steam only.   I would love to know your opinion on adjustments the following:  1- adding a valve after the pump for a manual flow control. I see form your screen you can set your pump speed but during operation I think you can‚Äôt fully control the flow from start to finish thus profiling is limited.   What did you use for water sealing on the hot side? I can see Teflon used before the boiler but I don‚Äôt believe it can handle high temperature much.   Using A PRV (pressure relief valve) on a second return loop. Form the picture I can see that your pressure gauge is showing pump pressure. The PRV will allow to set the maximum pressure on the portafilter  in which it will automatically loop back water if the pressure gets higher than your desired value. (Thus avoiding any hysteresis or misreading of the pressure sensor),i4qf8l2,/r/espresso/comments/u37fl9/diy_espresso_machine/i4qmr8t/'
i4roneq,2022-04-14 16:53:00,asoap,u37fl9,DIY Espresso Machine,Sorry to bug you again.   Let me see if Im getting this right.  Ive read the comments and I think I get it. But Im not 100%.   Attached to the wall is the reservoir.    That goes to the silver tube in the back with the brass fitting.  Thats your boiler.  And your boiler is just gravity filled?,i4qf8l2,/r/espresso/comments/u37fl9/diy_espresso_machine/i4roneq/'
i4reqcx,2022-04-14 15:39:34,iperrin17,u37fl9,DIY Espresso Machine,I removed the preinfusion orifice from the grouphead to minimize flow resistance. Because of this and due to the low flow rate of an espresso shot the pressure should be pretty consistent between the pump outlet and portafilter. I didnt do any math to check but that was my intuition.     For pressure control you are right the system can run the pump at preset pump speeds or a target pressure. Although on the upper-right corner of the control panel there is an Autosequence tab which I use to automatically change machine settings throughout the extraction (pseudo pressure-profiling). The preinfusion uses a preset speed until it reaches a target pressure (signifying puck saturation) or if it reaches a timeout (in case the pressure transition is set too high). Then it will run up to a target pressure for the main extraction and then slowly ramps down to avoid channeling after a preset time.     In the future I plan on modifying the control program so it can load a CSV file or something to have more complex cycles. I would also like to get reactive pressure-profiling so it will automatically scale back pressure during an extraction if the flow rate spikes (indicative of channeling),i4qmr8t,/r/espresso/comments/u37fl9/diy_espresso_machine/i4reqcx/'
i4rnt96,2022-04-14 16:46:41,Tahusan,u37fl9,DIY Espresso Machine,Your work is amazing. And I love the idea of varying flow rate electronically as it can give you even wider control and identical shots over and over. You can also introduce an equation with pressure speed  and time to make a varying  flow profile on the spot. Thanks for the sharing all the info and keep it up.   I‚Äôll probably go with Labview for such a project. And again great work!,i4reqcx,/r/espresso/comments/u37fl9/diy_espresso_machine/i4rnt96/'

i4mvrzd,2022-04-13 16:57:48,sympile,u33mxd,Need help purchase espresso machine,You should  stick with a super automatic.  Its a totally different experience using a grinder and a separate espresso machine. Is like being in a different universe.  Your parents make four drinks a day. To grind the beans rdt wdt tamp pull steam will be time consuming and requires a desire to want to do all that.  Its not as much fun as it sounds.   James Hoffman the espresso YouTuber made a recent video comparing different super automatics.  I believe there was a nice machine in your price range.  https://youtu.be/iZEM1cC86t8  Dont switch to a grinder and separate machine. Not after ten years.

I think it can make 5 shots in the morning. I also believe it will last 2 years. Breville has a 1 yr warranty and if you buy the machine with some specific credit cards you can get more years. It will last as long as what a bambino plus will last since they are almost the same except the auto milk steaming.

Doing them in bulk makes it a lot easier than one at a time thats for sure. And it exposes less air theoretically speaking since were opening the bag a lot less. Assuming that they will use two double shots worth of coffee everyday it will last like five days when working with ten test tubes.

i4mqlpy,2022-04-13 16:19:44,Wintermute1415,u331he,Suggestions for a College Student,I‚Äôd look into the flair line of manual espresso makers.

i4nj786,2022-04-13 19:51:49,tommyhateseveryone,u331he,Suggestions for a College Student,You seem more coffee focused than interested in milk drinks. I‚Äôd say for less than 150 get a really nice moka pot you‚Äôd have fun with and make great coffee with. Maybe Alessi 9090. Anything less than 300 or so new you‚Äôre going to find very disappointing. If you‚Äôre bent on espresso maybe a used gaggia classic and then you can go down the path of modding it. Above any brew methods a capable grinder will do you wonders.

i4mrlea,2022-04-13 16:26:54,Mr-Manky,u331he,Suggestions for a College Student,Check out the DeLonghi ECP series or Gaggia Carrezza [here](https://www.wholelattelove.com/collections/all-espresso-machines). I had one of the Delonghi ECP before I got my Gaggia Classic Pro. Pretty ok but the grinder will ultimately be you biggest factor. I‚Äôd also recommend something like the GCP when you can spare the cash. Yes they cost more but you can actually upgrade/buy repair parts and it isn‚Äôt unheard of for them to last 10+ years. My Delonghi lasted about a year and a half before the heating element died and they wouldn‚Äôt sell me just the part so I had to junk the whole thing. Definitely a big difference in quality and longevity between espresso appliances (think box store like Walmart) and espresso machines.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u331he/suggestions_for_a_college_student/i4mrlea/'

My JX-Pro is a paper weight now I only take camping. Buy or make a WDT with long needles can be a cork base. Key is to stir and settle an evenly mixed loose puck (tap the side to level) before doing a nice even tamp. I have a bottomless PF I run a blank shot first on my B+ and I still find it‚Äôs not hot enough for light roasts. The black plastic inside the spouted PF‚Äôs actually increase pressure which produces greater heat. Don‚Äôt be afraid to play around with different baskets grind sizes and manual pull times while weighing your input/output to find what tastes best to you. It might not be the standard of using non-pressurized 1:2 ratio over 25-30s since the Bambino cannot adjust temp or bar. Those silver 0.1g scales with the blue screen on Amazon work great and don‚Äôt cost much. Also buy a PF ring/funnel that sits on the PF keeps things clean when you dump grinds in and lets you WDT mix without spillage.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u32nte/bambino_plus_upgrades/i4na5sc/'

i4p7exi,2022-04-14 06:47:14,Bgnome,u32niy,Choosing between two espresso makers for a newbie,I love to tinker so it was worth it to me to learn how everything works and upgrade bits as I go along.  If you count all the accessories and parts that I purchased (pressure gauge PID steam wand gasket kit OPV spring bottomless portafilter baskets etc.) that eats a serious chunk of that $160 difference.  But then again you are likely to buy a bunch of stuff for the Infuser as well.  The Sirena is sort of a Gaggia Classic with some Saeco super-auto upgrades like a stainless steel  boiler volumetric control and a separate steam thermoloop boiler.

i4my4bd,2022-04-13 17:14:59,know7501,u31ig2,Rocket Fausto Owners?,I like ours.  We have had it for about a year. 1000 plus shots in and it is well seasoned. It does clump I wouldn‚Äôt say a lot but it is consistent. I have run 5 different beans from different roasters for 2-3 months at a time. Bean size(smaller) makes for a more consistent output in terms of weight. All relatively similar in roast medium dark. But vastly different grind settings.   It is well built fairly quiet and very easy to use.  Matches very nicely with the Appartamentto.   If you can avoid touch screens for button activation I would. Solely for the longevity of usage.

i4nufgq,2022-04-13 21:32:19,butt_muppet,u31ig2,Rocket Fausto Owners?,Used a Fausto for about two years daily. The grind quality is nice no crazy clumping (WDT is recommended) and the motor isn‚Äôt loud and irritating. Nice acidity in the cup. It‚Äôs a good grinder but has flaws.   The retention is pretty bad and the hopper is enormous. It‚Äôs probably suited better for pulling a ton of shots per day versus repeatability every day. The hopper makes the grinder tall and it‚Äôs not easily replaced with something smaller. You may have issues with it fitting under your cabinets. It‚Äôs also a heavy grinder. The stepless grind knob is nice to turn but I found the markings a little annoying at times.   After a couple of years I bought a niche and now the Fausto never gets used.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u31ig2/rocket_fausto_owners/i4nufgq/'

i4mfe4c,2022-04-13 14:59:31,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u30j29,Seattle Coffee Gear - Having a bad time,Sorry about your poor experience with SCG. They should be ashamed of themselves.  But Im curious about what troubleshooting steps you took. 99% of the time the symptoms you experienced are caused by grinding too fine which chokes the machine. The machine shutting off during a very long pull is normal - this is done to prevent overheating the pump which has a maximum duty cycle of 1 to 2 minutes.  The most common machine fault that would cause a slow pull would be a bad pump. Unfortunately the Appartamento doesnt have a pump pressure gauge so its hard to test that. But a good test would be to measure the water flow with no coffee in the portafilter. You should get a water flow of about 8g/sec. If you are in that ballpark your machine is almost certainly OK.  I suggest you try pulling a shot with your Niche grinding extremely coarse at setting #50. If you still get a very slow pull then you do have a defective machine. But Im guessing you will get a very fast gusher. At that point you know there is a grind setting somewhere between your recommended setting and 50 that will give you a good shot. If that setting is way above the Niches espresso range then you should check your grinders calibration.  Odds are high that you should be able to enjoy some great espresso while waiting for SCG to take care of you.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u30j29/seattle_coffee_gear_having_a_bad_time/i4mfe4c/'
i4mdfnl,2022-04-13 14:46:22,Bad_Droid,u30j29,Seattle Coffee Gear - Having a bad time,I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your experience.  Regarding troubleshooting though you mentioned that ‚ÄúI use the niche grinder at recommended espresso settings‚Äù. There‚Äôs no such thing.  Needed grind size can vary incredibly based on bean roast age. As for the niche a 15 on unit could be a 13 on another to give identical grind.  Assuming the machine was actually working if it takes a long time for espresso to come out grind coarser. Keep grinding coarser until it speeds up.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u30j29/seattle_coffee_gear_having_a_bad_time/i4mdfnl/'
i4mea85,2022-04-13 14:52:06,MumblesBarn,u30j29,Seattle Coffee Gear - Having a bad time,I‚Äôm not going to comment on SCG but have you tested the water flow from the machine without a portafilter in place?   Does water flow? If so how long does it take to fill an 8oz cup with water? If it‚Äôs a reasonable time then the issue is with the coffee not the machine.    Fully understand if you‚Äôd rather switch to a new machine but I‚Äôm happy to help you try and trouble shoot it if you‚Äôd like.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u30j29/seattle_coffee_gear_having_a_bad_time/i4mea85/'

Run the machine with an empty portafilter and see if you have the same issues.

My issues with my machine may in fact have to do with my grind size - I guess I‚Äôm a bigger noob than I realized and it looks like a significantly larger grind size & re-calibration of the Niche may fix my issues. Seattle Coffee Gear reached out this evening with my requested return information (4 days after my request) so I don‚Äôt mean to throw them under the bus too much - I was just frustrated with how slow their responses were (I‚Äôm assuming they are short staffed) and it would have been nice if they could have specifically recommended a larger grind size as that may be my only issue. The experience overall was just kind of a letdown & thus I‚Äôm a little bit undecided whether to keep the machine or continue with the return. They were slow but I appreciate SCG working with me and being fair.  Many thanks to this subreddit!

The instructions for the simple process are in the user manual. If its significantly mis-calibrated it could be grinding much finer than you think. 2. If calibrated try grinding at about 15 to start on the Niche. That should put you in the ballpark.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u30j29/seattle_coffee_gear_having_a_bad_time/i4n6p3h/'

If youre able to figure out the grind issues I think youll really have fun with the Appartamento especially as a first machine which is also my case. Ive been using mine paired with the Rocket Faustino grinder for just over a year now and have really loved it as a first machine especially with small upgrades like an E61 group head thermometer bottomless portafilter upgraded shower screen and basket and better tamper.  My plans are to use my Rocket Appartamento for a few years until Im ready for a more frills machine and upgrade to something a bit next level.  Just saying if youve already got the machine in place and upgraded add-ons as someone new to espresso youre in a GREAT spot to learn a ton and drink a lot of great espresso for a good long while.,i4nsc9t,/r/espresso/comments/u30j29/seattle_coffee_gear_having_a_bad_time/i4pm238/'

i4m7e7w,2022-04-13 14:06:22,guanacazo,u306c0,What do you taste for when dialing in espresso?,There are so many variables.  When dialing my espresso the most important is balance of extraction.  If overextracted tastes astringent if underextracted tastes bland.

i4msofn,2022-04-13 16:34:49,slickmamba,u306c0,What do you taste for when dialing in espresso?,1:2 in 25-30 is a starting point not a rule of thumb.    I usually try to go based on the tasting notes on the bag.  Lighter roasts I will usually crank my temp up(203F+) pull a longer shot(1:2.5-3).  I currently do lots of profiling stuff but if I was to start from the beginning with standard stock flow rates I would probably aim for a 10-15s preinfusion 1:2.5-3 in roughly 45s and go from there.  For med roast id probably go for a 10s preinfusion stock flow rate 198-202F 1:2-2.3 in roughly 30-35s.  From there I would taste and see if I am getting any unwanted notes astringency bitterness overly sour etc.  I would then adjust my shots from there.  The barista hustle espresso compass is a really useful tool for tasting and dialing in the shots.    I dont really do dark roasts but probably 10s preinfusion 1:2 in 25-30s 195-198F  If you are always tasting sour you could be getting bitter-sour confusion your water chemistry is very off temp is too low or channeling(but you say you dont get any)/uneven extraction.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u306c0/what_do_you_taste_for_when_dialing_in_espresso/i4msofn/'
i4ns4lf,2022-04-13 21:09:35,ggcadc,u306c0,What do you taste for when dialing in espresso?,So if you‚Äôre in that range and still getting a sour shot I‚Äôd check temp. Others have mentioned pulling longer to increase yield and that‚Äôs another good idea if your temp is stable through the shot. You‚Äôd be amazed how much changes as the ratio changes a 1:2 vs 1:2.5 can be worlds apart.  Edit: you asked what to taste for but I think you‚Äôve got it. Sour is a good marker as well as bitterness. I much prefer a sour shot to a bitter shot in general but getting them in balance is really what we‚Äôre all looking for.   One day you will have a god shot and from that day forward you will have a reference for what you want ti replicate. Hopefully on that day you used your scale and weren‚Äôt just winging it so you know what to do to replicate it.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u306c0/what_do_you_taste_for_when_dialing_in_espresso/i4ns4lf/'

I drink espressos Italian style (read: quickly) and heat water in my mugs in the microwave and then dump it into the yeti to pre-warm it.

i4lt4oy,2022-04-13 12:31:08,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u2xq7t,Any tips?,Grind and dose:yield ratio are independent adjustments. You adjust the yield by pulling the shot manually with a scale under your cup/mug/glass so you can stop the shot at your desired yield. Once you find the best tasting ratio you can further improve your shot by varying the grind.  Guidelines like 1:2 in 30 seconds are intended to be good starting points but not the end goal. Once you get there keep experimenting with tweaking the ratio and grind size for best taste.  The 870s grinder has a very large step size so you may find the grind you want is between 2 grind settings. You can work around this by varying the dose (larger dose will slow down the shot smaller dose will speed it up). When varying the dose you should also proportionally vary the yield to keep the ratio constant.,i4lqxor,/r/espresso/comments/u2xq7t/any_tips/i4lt4oy/'
i4ltd3n,2022-04-13 12:32:44,all_systems_failing,u2xq7t,Any tips?,1:2 is a starting point. You may have to adjust yield to get the taste youre looking for so 1:1.5 may be optimal or 1:2.5 all depending on the coffee.  20g is slightly higher than recommended for the stock basket. Is there a reason youre dosing so much?  Grinding finer or adjusting yield all depends on your personal taste. If you want to slow the shot down and get a lower yield in that time youll need to grind finer.,i4lqxor,/r/espresso/comments/u2xq7t/any_tips/i4ltd3n/'

i4lx7cw,2022-04-13 12:58:34,all_systems_failing,u2xq7t,Any tips?,Using the tamper edge as a guide ensures you havent dosed too much. Its okay to dose less as long as its within the baskets range which I think is 16-19g for the 2-shot basket.,i4lw8w1,/r/espresso/comments/u2xq7t/any_tips/i4lx7cw/'

i4l603f,2022-04-13 10:01:56,Humbi5,u2v08c,Day one: Trial and Error,Thanks to these wonderful coffee sub-reddits I decided to buy a flair 58 as my first espresso machine. After I made the purchase I spent every day that it hadn‚Äôt come in watching videos reading forum posts and getting my hands on any resource I could find. You guys have been a wonderful resource and I hope I can continue to learn from y‚Äôall :)  I put it together last night and was able to pull pretty good shot out of the stock pressurized basket. I decided to switch it out for the high flow basket. I have pulled more shots than I can count this morning and I can‚Äôt seem to get a good one.  For context I am using an Ethiopian light roast that I ground on my Comandante red clix at a nine which I then use the WDT on and tamped with the stock flare tamp.  A lot of the pucks that I have been pulling this morning from the new basket have been atrocious. I have ground finer I have ground courser and I am at my wits end.   Any advice?

i4l7s9e,2022-04-13 10:13:24,Clayspinner,u2v08c,Day one: Trial and Error,Light roasts are challenging at times.  I‚Äôd personally consider starting with a good medium roast and go from there.  Nail down your work flow dialling in procedure and ability to manipulate the variables you can control (grind water temp dose time) so that you can change the flavour of your coffee to your liking.  Then I‚Äôd tackle light roasts.     As an aside‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had my best ever shot from an Ethiopian light roasts with a 54 second extraction with water at 204degs.

i4oruur,2022-04-14 04:34:48,Drakonbreath,u2v08c,Day one: Trial and Error,Did you summon a devil?  On a note serious note I suggest starting with something a bit simpler than a 20 second preinsfusion. Thats honestly probably too much especially at 3 bar.   Firstly make sure your puck prep is correct. For WDT watch Lance Hedricks video on his WDT method. Its worked the best for me and try to finish your WDT by just WDTing the very top to get a very even surface before tamping. Make sure to WDT the edges as well especially if youre using a funnel which could prevent the needles from reaching the edge. In that case after WDTing with the funnel on take it off and distribute the edges and then level the surface. Dont tap the portafilter after WDTing just tamp straight away.   Of course try to get as level a tamp as possible. Dont polish (spin the tamper) after tamping just tamp straight down evenly and then pull out. Its hard to over tamp so dont be too worried. Just tamp hard and level. I suggest your get the normcore v4 tamper as it will help you immensely. Itll fit the basket far better will self level and take the guesswork out of the pressure. But for now the stock tamper will do.   I saw someone mention a puck screen but you already have the Flair puck screen and that is as good as any puck screen on the market. Just make sure you dont forget to use it. Pulling a shot without the puck screen on the 58 will ruin your shot. Also make sure to leave the puck screen in the portafilter while the machine is preheating so that the puck screen preheats as well. Oh yeah make sure to keep the portafilter locked into the machine so that it preheats.   Now for your shot try getting your shot around this: start timer and start pulling lever and hold at 2 bar until timer hits 10 seconds. Then ramp up to 9 bar in about 3-5 seconds (so gradually get to 9 but not too slowly) and hold at 9 bar until youre at 30ish grams out and then ramp down to zero until you get 40 grams out. Basically try to hit 0 bars of pressure as your shot reaches 40 grams. Oh yeah go for an 18 in 40 out ratio. Aim to finish pulling your shot at no less than 40 seconds and no more than 45. And then adjust your time (grind size) based on taste.  Your grind size will basically determine how long you hold at 9 bars as the first few steps I recommended were time based rather than flow based. Adjust grind size until you can finish the shot in between 40 and 45 seconds. Then adjust grind size based on taste. Master this before trying anything else.   An important note is that while its hard to tell much about the shot by looking at the puck after the shot it shouldnt be cracked like it was in your picture. It could be because of puck prep or grind size but it could very well be because you put too much coffee in the basket maybe 18 is too much. To test this put a penny on your puck of coffee (freshly ground and tamped not used) and put the puck screen on top of the coin. Then lock the portafilter in wait a few seconds and then remove the portafilter. Dont pull a shot. Remove the puck screen and the coin. If the coin left a decent imprint on the pucks surface you have too much coffee. Lower the amount of coffee in the basket and retest. If you need to lower it try 17 in and 37 out then 16 in and 35 out 15 in and 33 out etc... Dont adjust the time time should remain the same. Grind size will change but let the time firstly determine the grind size and then taste.   After you sort of get this down you can try even making the first step of preinsfusion flow based rather than time based. Basically end your 2 bar (again not 3) preinsfusion when the first few drops hit the cup. If it takes longer than 15 secs go coarser and if it takes less than 10 than go finer. And of course adjust based on taste. Maybe longer than 15 secs will taste better or shorter than 10 will be better. But start with between 10 and 15.   All this is for 18 in and 40 out. If you make shots with more out (like 18 in 55 out) then youll have to go coarser. If you want to mess with the ratios FIRST get my first recipe down. 18 in and 40 out in between 40 and 45 seconds then adjusted for taste. And to play with the ratio after that try to get your espresso finished in the same exact time as your 18 in and 40 out recipe. If you have that dialed in to say 48 seconds try an 18 in 55 out shot at 48 seconds (youll have to go coarser to get this) and then adjust to taste.   This got way too lengthy but hope it helps.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2v08c/day_one_trial_and_error/i4oruur/'
i4lbpj3,2022-04-13 10:38:21,One_Left_Shoe,u2v08c,Day one: Trial and Error,First off: post-pull puck diagnoses is astrology at best. It doesnt really tell you much. Go off of how the shot *tastes*. Why is it bad when  you grind finer? Why is it bad when you grind coarser? Are you adjusting your dose or just grind?  On the technical side how long does it take to pull your shot? How many grams in and out are you getting? Preheating the chamber? Water temp? Do you have a pressure gauge? If so what is your pressure through the shot? Preinsfusion?  Need lots more information to diagnose whats going on here.,i4l603f,/r/espresso/comments/u2v08c/day_one_trial_and_error/i4lbpj3/'

i4qlj64,2022-04-14 12:19:24,Humbi5,u2v08c,Day one: Trial and Error,I appreciate the thesis this is what I come here for!  Why is 3 bar too much for pre-infusion? I only came up with that number because every resource I could find used 3.   I do WDT but I tap on the counter to level before I tamp. I‚Äôll try just tamping from there to see if that helps. Also thanks for the recommendation on the tamper I have been looking for a good recommendation for a self leveler. I have the stock 58 one atm.   I always leave the port filter and puck screen while I preheat (two days lol) so I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm doing that right.   Thanks for the recipe. It feels like I have so many different ones running though my head that I don‚Äôt have a stock one that works. I‚Äôll try this tomorrow and see how that goes.   I think I started way too fine. I got self conscious about grinding too course so I hit the other end of that spectrum. I am going courser and today I pulled a good shot that didn‚Äôt blow my puck out.  It‚Äôs not too much coffee but I‚Äôm glad you added that bit for future reference.   Again thanks for the repeatable in depth recipe and I hope I can incorporate this in my next try.,i4oruur,/r/espresso/comments/u2v08c/day_one_trial_and_error/i4qlj64/'

The shots were definitely not good so the post puck was just ‚Äúconfirmation.‚Äù  Finer was giving me more acidity and courser was giving me short shots that were more watery. I was just adjusting the grind. I was doing 18g in and 36g out.   I was able to get it from 30-55 seconds depending on the grind. I set the preheat to the third setting and I was putting water off the boil into the chamber. I was pre infusing at 3bar for 20 seconds then ramping up to 9bar. Then dropping pressure as I got closer to the 36g out I wanted.   Thanks for all the questions. I hope this helps!,i4lbpj3,/r/espresso/comments/u2v08c/day_one_trial_and_error/i4liq6p/'

i4rx9dy,2022-04-14 18:00:09,Drakonbreath,u2v08c,Day one: Trial and Error,No worries!  For preinsfusion you generally want it to be gentle. To soak the puck without putting too much pressure which can force the water to choose channels before soaking the puck. So you can even try ramping up to 2 bar in 5 seconds rather than slamming 2 bars right away and then hold for 10 seconds (total of 15 s). Theres a lot to play around with. I cant say that 3 bar is wrong but 2 bar has worked better for me. I think the more important part is that 20 second preinsfusion seems a bit long as a starting point.   Theres another method called blooming espresso where you quickly take the pressure to 3 bars but then let it go (dont hold the handle) and wait for 30 seconds and start pulling again. Thats a whole other ballgame maybe thats where you got the 3 bar number maybe not.   I was in a similar position as you as in I had the ability to pressure profile but didnt know how to start. I did a lot of research and the method I gave you was what I ended up with. As a great starting point when dialing in a bean. 18 in and 40 out in 45 seconds with a 10-15 second preinsfusion at 2 bar. And then adjusting based on taste.   Oh one thing to point out is that generally the finer you go the slower the shot is. But way too fine can make the puck crack and cause a fast shot (or so Ive heard never happened to me) so maybe be wary of that is something happens out of the ordinary where your ground finer and the shot was faster.   Hope this helps you keep me posted on the results!,i4qlj64,/r/espresso/comments/u2v08c/day_one_trial_and_error/i4rx9dy/'
i4lkncq,2022-04-13 11:34:50,One_Left_Shoe,u2v08c,Day one: Trial and Error,Ok to refine a bit more on the finer grind would you call the acidity more like a tart/sour raspberry or other fruit? Or was it acidic like mild acid regurgitation like a burp that leaves a sour taste in your mouth?  light roasts are going to have tart to acidic qualities in them from a drip let alone the concentrated espresso.   I would go back to fine maybe up your dose by half a gram and try again.  When you taste it try to see if you can work out the kind of acidity it reminds you of. You can also cut the espresso afterwards with a bit of hot water to see if that helps give a little space between flavor characteristics.   For a light Ethiopian I would expect lots of berry tartness and honestly not a ton of body.,i4liq6p,/r/espresso/comments/u2v08c/day_one_trial_and_error/i4lkncq/'

i4v07f0,2022-04-15 11:12:54,Humbi5,u2v08c,Day one: Trial and Error,After fighting with FedEx for three days I was able to get my Acaia Lunar from their grasp! I also canceled my dosing funnel order and bought one with next day shipping. So when I got home yesterday I had two new tools at my disposal.   I started going finer until I pulled a 20 second shot. Then I went back one click and started working there. I was able to pull two amazing shots yesterday (one was an accident that even had channeling). Once that sweet nectar hit my mouth I knew my pain was not for nothing. I had dialed in my bean.   The dosing funnel gave me the ability to WDT more aggressively without losing coffee from the portafilter which helped immensely. Then the Acaia Lunar showed me the flow rate which helped me dial in the grind. I followed Lance Hedrick‚Äôs advice of 1.5g flow rate.   I changed to the 2 bar pre-infusion and I think it helped out.   This morning I tried to do the same thing as last night but it came out a little fast. I think the only thing that is inconsistent now is my tamp. Every other variable is easy to control but I think that‚Äôs the only one that varies from shot to shot. I ordered the Normcore V4 so until then I wait.   Overall I at least know that good shots are possible. For a while I wondered if my roast was off (I roast my own beans).

i4nb1l4,2022-04-13 18:48:54,MainerH55,u2uqg8,Problem with bitterness.,You likely need a faster shot and less yield if it truly is bitter. Try 27g out @ 25s.

You can practice latte art with some food coloring in water there are good videos if you search for practice latte art as well.   Check out the James Hoffman espresso series they are long but go into great detail into the different parts of espresso.   Robusta is very traditional usually in darker traditional espresso roasts. Nothing wrong with it but most specialty coffee is arabica.  Just a taste preference.   Beans and roast level play a huge role. You may not like the burnt/toasty notes of traditional espresso. You may like something more medium or lighter. Fresher is better for starter beans but I would say Trader Joe‚Äôs has some solid med beans to get started with just to learn the ropes.  They can be old and stale though so try to find out which ones are fresher. I would go with their small lot stuff.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2tzka/a_few_beginner_questions/i4ld0gv/'

To think that beans sourced from various parts of the world will roast totally evenly is a bit off-base.   What makes blends very interesting is precisely that you can get flavors that cannot be achieved using single origins.

Also wanting to make sure I have all I need I bought a bottomless portafilter with an ims 18g nanotech basket no shower head got an upgraded group gasket (install or wait till failure) I got a tamper and tamp base. The grinder comes with wdt rdt cup and funnel.   Any suggestions idk if I‚Äôm missing anything lastly what are some firsts to do? I plan on buying 5lbs of coffee and I have a few pounds of old beans I‚Äôll just run through the grinder. Was thinking of running a tank or two through the machine? Would it be overkill to cafiza before even using it?,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2tb0g/hi_gang_grinder_and_machine_en_route_wanted_scale/i4kvexf/'

In fact I recently switched from a cheaper WDT with thicker wires to one that uses eight or nine acupuncture needles. The difference in shot quality was surprising the thinner needles fluffed the coffee and produced a rounder smoother shot than the thicker WDT.

i4kejtr,2022-04-13 07:03:58,IamOiman,u2qyt5,1956 Gaggia Internazionale restored by me with all exterior surfaces kept original,This guy has been fighting for the last few months before I finally got the boiler lid to seal nicely. There are some very small adjustments I need to make with the body panels but this machine runs nicely when pressurized and fully warmed up. Only the insides received a full cleaning of new protective paint for frame and a cleaning of the boiler. The exterior is fully original no new chrome or plating.  The heating elements produce 1100W and 190W (the latter is one of the original 220V elements so it produces 1/4 the rated power on 110V) when wired in parallel which is sufficient for the 5 liter boiler. It takes about an hour for the grouphead to heat up fully from cold.  The Gaggia lever group is the first modern espresso group head developed from a patent developed in the late 1930s but not able to be produced until after World War II. While they can be a pain to service I honestly believe its really hard to beat the quality of shot.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2qyt5/1956_gaggia_internazionale_restored_by_me_with/i4kejtr/'

i4o0f1t,2022-04-13 22:37:24,caprimulgusAU,u2qtcr,S.E.P. Gauge or No Gauge?,Im going to order the BT transducer and analog gauge for the Argos (with y splitter) for those times when I cant be bothered pulling out my phone and looking at a graph. (I dont want to be swapping between the two and wearing out the threads)  The alternative would be just to pull blindly without measuring the pressure - once youve got it down-pat muscle memory and feel should be enough to get a rough idea where you are in terms of pressure. Or you can just monitor the flow/output instead. So really a gauge is not necessary.  But I like having the gauge on my Flair (Signature) anyway and I use it for every shot (as a crutch). YMMV  Is it necessary? Absolutely not. Is it a nice to have? If you arent going to use the SEP for every shot and still want to have a gauge to fall back on then sure (otherwise its probably a waste of money).,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2qtcr/sep_gauge_or_no_gauge/i4o0f1t/'

More info in comments.,Ive been prototyping an affordable easy to print rotating WDT for the past few days. What you see here is functional but very rough since no aesthetic treatments or proportions have been tweaked. But for the important part...  Its almost fully 3D printed except for the needles 2 ball bearings and an M3 screw. It takes about 10 hours to print on a normal printer with minimal supports. The action on it is super smooth thanks to the ball bearings. The height of the needles is adjustable through a 3D printed thread that is solid and locks in place securely.  I plan to sell these on my etsy store as kits for folks to assemble themselves to keep the cost low. Somewhere in the range of $40 for just the printed parts (if you want to source the hardware yourself) or about $55 for a kit that includes printed parts plus all the hardware.  Obviously a 3D printed tool will not compare in feel and quality to the Duomo tool but hopefully this idea gets folks excited enough to maybe warrant spending the money on the real deal once they see how great the results are.

i4kv3fl,2022-04-13 08:53:01,Napoleon_Bonerparte,u2pxn6,Do I need leveler distribution tool?,This. I have never used any of these tools and I learned on a very picky Silvia and Baratza grinder (before that was a really shitty 15 bar no name). I‚Äôve been fine with the same technique for 10+ years with hand tapping and a tamper.   If you prefer tools and think they make things easier great but none of them are strictly necessary.   I think there is a lot of emphasis on taking shortcuts when the truth is pulling 10 shitty shots but getting consistent results is more important than pulling the 2-3 good shots out of 10. You won‚Äôt improve if you don‚Äôt master consistency and I personally believe these tools can be an over engineering endeavor of what ultimately distills down to a matter of practice.   I‚Äôve wasted tons of good beans practicing before I got the hang of it and that‚Äôs just part of the learning curve.,i4kh3nc,/r/espresso/comments/u2pxn6/do_i_need_leveler_distribution_tool/i4kv3fl/'

i4kf9m5,2022-04-13 07:09:03,SnS_Carmine,u2pxn6,Do I need leveler distribution tool?,Thats just because he used wdt poorly  You gotta tap to make the air pop out and check the rim of the puck to see if it is level thorough  I some time just have a straight up hill on one side and a ravine on the other side. Even tho it looked like it would be flat tho some of it is due to me tapping wrong sometimes  Leveling tools are supposed to do one thing: distribute evenly. An even distribution will result in a flat puck. But they have their flaws as they also lightly compress the puck  Anyway distribut evenly... W. Distribution T.

The stock profiles come with like range of operation triggers. So for instance if it senses its flowing too fast (based on the profile youve selected) it will do the steps indicated by being outside the ideal parameter. Like itll decrease pressure or slow down flow (whatever the profile is set up to do in that case). That way youll still get a decent shot even if it was pushing the edges of the set parameters. It kinda self-corrects. In my experience if youre using good beans and good water it is pretty hard to fvck up the shot. Like you have to TRY to fvck it up on purpose.,i4kf877,/r/espresso/comments/u2olp6/assuming_budget_is_no_issue_what_is_your_dream/i4kgfw8/'
i4krgq9,2022-04-13 08:29:39,UniqueLoginID,u2np36,What are my Lagom P64 burr options for espresso?,Refresher on the SSP burrs: [https://www.option-o.com/faq-lagom-p64](https://www.option-o.com/faq-lagom-p64)  I have SSP brew (aka unimodal v1) and SSP high uniformity aka espresso.  I also have Mazzer Mini Electronic 64mm and Mazzer Super Jolly.  The SSP HU are better than the Mazzer burrs. Better mouthfeel and texture little easier to dial can get great flavour consistently. I havent had as much clarity as I was getting from the Mini E burrs but that could also be down to bean selection so I wouldnt hold that against them for that.  Would I say I can pick the SSP HU from the Mazzer reliably? yes.  &#x200B  My intention was to run the burrs side by side and do triangle tests and test with the refractometer but by the time the burrs were seasoned I got sick and my taste went off. So I froze my best beans.  Now my taste is mostly good and my element has gone which is a full machine tear down to replace.  So I cant offer the data I would have hoped to have had to offer a few weeks ago.     If you use it for filter coffee the Mazzer burrs are a let down and the HU lack the clarity of the UMv1/brew. You could be better off with the SSP UMv2/MP so that you can use one burr for both purposes see the link I originally shared.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2np36/what_are_my_lagom_p64_burr_options_for_espresso/i4krgq9/'

i4jw4pu,2022-04-13 04:31:19,kjr51922,u2np36,What are my Lagom P64 burr options for espresso?,You can get some super jolly or other generic 64mm flat burrs for around $60. I have the ‚Äústandard‚Äù option-o P64 burrs siting in my drawer that I‚Äôll never use again that I can give you for the cost of shipping if you want.   My main question is why not put some nice burrs in it? You spent a lot of money on the P64 and it‚Äôs an incredible grinder so might as well spend the extra $100 and put in some premium burrs. The SSP multipurpose produce unbelievable espresso and are also fantastic for drip. Many prefer the MPs to the V1 Unimodal for drip.   Also since there are burr options for the P64 on all points of the clarity vs texture spectrum you could choose a burr set that highlights different characteristics than your primary grinder. The Option-O burr diagram of in the P64 FAQ section of their website is fantastic and spot on in my experience.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2np36/what_are_my_lagom_p64_burr_options_for_espresso/i4jw4pu/'
i4jvyba,2022-04-13 04:29:28,-_Blacklight_-,u2np36,What are my Lagom P64 burr options for espresso?,SSP Unimodal: They are perfectly fine for espresso. If you are grinding near the zero point you might need to properly align the burrs. They also might be finicky with some techniques like using higher flow baskets flow/pressure profiling and smaller doses so if you combine some of them you might have some difficulties. They will need a finer grind for sure so the integrity of the puck might be destroyed too fast if your puck prep is not on par. The speed of the grinder is also more important when using this burrs set so you might want to run it at 9 to create more fines to help you out adjusting your technique to the burrs set and some people are even dropping the pump pressure a bit. The best for brewing and lighter roasts avoid darker beans.  SSP Multipurpose: They are the same as the unimodal burrs set but they do have some flats on the outer edge to create more fines. They are still very good for brewing and lighter roasts but they are less finicky regarding techniques and puck prep.  SSP HU: Those high uniformity burrs are much less unimodal so you can basically pull your shots the same way as you are pulling them with your primary grinder without any other learning curve. They are also well suited for other type of beans for a more traditional espresso tasting buds. They are a good all-around burrs set without performing at best in any department. They might be the kind of burrs you are looking for.  You can also look into other burrs types/manufacturers but since I am more experienced using SSP burrs in general I will let other users chime in and give you quality recommandations.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2np36/what_are_my_lagom_p64_burr_options_for_espresso/i4jvyba/'

You need to take it off and check it is clean and the holes are clear.  The shower screen is really the outlet for the water inlet manifold so the hot water is pumped in behind it filling the void then moving onwards to the PF and puck. At this time the voids will be full of water and the flow will be quite different from the non-pressurised flow you can see the flow is likely to be much more even when under pressure.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2niy8/how_do_i_fix_uneven_water_distribution_on_my/i4k5qt3/'

I can‚Äôt get the coffee to come out and I thought I should try to troubleshoot.,You deacaled the machine but dont have a screwdriver readily available? Im curious as to how you descaled the machine?  What process did you take?  What product did you use?  How did you empty the deacaling solution?  If you descaled a a machine you break up the scale. Alot of it will be in solution and exit when you drain your boiler. However some larger bits of scale may remain and some parts that have not completely come off the boiler. Some of this may come off when flushing the boiler out with water. It is possible though depending on how you decided to drain/flush machine that scale deposits may hav migrated into the group assembly dispersion screen/block. Your solenoid is probably fine at least.   This looks to be a problem right at your group. Id replace the screen and other dispersion materials if damaged or heavily worn/clogged. In the future always start at the group cleaning dispersion materials. Improper dispersion at the group is not often caused by boiler scale. Inconsistent/improper flow/pressure without dispersion materials in place is more of an indicator of boiler scale.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2niy8/how_do_i_fix_uneven_water_distribution_on_my/i4kj655/'

For most machines (maybe this one too): Behind the screen is a brass distribution plate with less holes (<10) and behind that is the actual water output. Clean out those holes and when reassembling make sure the distribution plate holes do NOT line up with the water output. That way water hits a solid part of the plate and distribute before getting out to the screen.,i4k3rx0,/r/espresso/comments/u2niy8/how_do_i_fix_uneven_water_distribution_on_my/i4k4wwn/'

It is just standard cleaning procedure.  You can also use a filter paper or a puck screen on top to make sure coffee grounds do not get to the shower head but it does not stop coffee and oil to get suck back in. It is still recommended to clean the shower head once a while you just dont need to waste that little bit of water purging the head every time.,i4jwnzv,/r/espresso/comments/u2niy8/how_do_i_fix_uneven_water_distribution_on_my/i4k4b6a/'

i4jkw2h,2022-04-13 02:09:35,MikeTheBlueCow,u2lvvg,Acaia Brewmaster app issues & annoyances,Theyve always been this way with the apps. How well the app works seems to depend on your phone model. The brewmaster app works well for me the main app is buggy and rarely connects. I honestly dont think they care about the apps its like a false promise to get you to buy their insanely expensive hardware and here I am with two acaia scales that I just use like regular scales.  They even added some of the app functionality into the newer pearl from what I can tell with the flow rate detection? Seems to me like even theyre trying to avoid users having to use their crappy apps.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2lvvg/acaia_brewmaster_app_issues_annoyances/i4jkw2h/'

I wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed in your purchase because of the app the scale is a really good scale on its own. It‚Äôs the fastest and most consistent one I‚Äôve used it‚Äôs water resistant and the the new model with the flow meter on it is pretty sweet.   The only time I use the app is for the remote scale when I brew chemex because it covers the display.

I wish they made a version for iPhones (/Android) as well.  The new 2021 model with flow rate indicator came out just when I ran out of the free replacement period with my Lunar very frustrating.

i4xwalj,2022-04-16 03:04:24,ckristo,u2lvvg,Acaia Brewmaster app issues & annoyances,Some impressions after using it a week now:  * management of brews especially because brew methods and beans are managed on their own is really a breeze - I do not find myself enter a lot of information for a brew (compared to the Brewmaster app). A brew needs only a few parameters: select beans select brew method and grams in - that‚Äòs it  * The app shows a lot of useful information e.g. it shows how much grams of beans are left based on past brews how old the beans are at the time of the brew caffeine consumption costs etc.  * smart scale is recognized and brew starts automatically once the smart scale detects flow / the timer is started on the scale manually  I‚Äòm happy so far with it. The only thing I noticed sometimes - it draws quite a lot of battery on my iPhone when not closed (after I started using my smart scales) not a big issue for me I simply close the app after brewing.,i4xvdzn,/r/espresso/comments/u2lvvg/acaia_brewmaster_app_issues_annoyances/i4xwalj/'

i4jgcte,2022-04-13 01:04:33,mediumredbutton,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,No try 18g of beans at 1:2 or 1:2.5.  Edit: obviously you need scales - esprssso doesn‚Äôt have the same density as water  If you want a more watery drink then add water don‚Äôt just run more water through the coffee.  This gets you a solid thick modern-Australian-style espresso.  If you want traditional Italian espresso or what Starbucks sells then you want completely different numbers.  It‚Äôs a drink make what you like.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2l9cv/can_someone_help_me_understand_ratios_please/i4jgcte/'
i4jgr03,2022-04-13 01:10:14,slickmamba,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,Ratios are coffee in:coffee out by weight. So a 18g dose you‚Äôll want 36g of espresso out. Don‚Äôt use volume to measure use weight.   There are lots of awful espresso videos online most of them are going to give you a ‚Äúgolden rule‚Äù of 1:2 in 25-30s. It‚Äôs more of a starting point and not a rule.   Check out the barista hustle espresso compass great tool and accompanying articles on dialing in.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2l9cv/can_someone_help_me_understand_ratios_please/i4jgr03/'
i4jjb6t,2022-04-13 01:47:03,MarcTes,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,I began with the standard 1:2 ratio but discovered that I prefer 1:1.75 instead as it produces a more concentrated shot.  I start with 20 g of coffee (using a 20 g precision basket in a bottomless portafilter) with a weighed espresso output of 35 g brewed between 28 and 33 seconds.  (Brew temperature is about 198 F. ) This seems to work well for high-quality medium dark roast beans.    Play around and have fun. It‚Äôs great discovering new recipes to suit your taste. I use a combination scale/timer which I find indispensable for consistency and constantly checking the grind as it changes throughout the week as the beans age. I‚Äôve found that I have to gradually grind finder as the beans mature.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2l9cv/can_someone_help_me_understand_ratios_please/i4jjb6t/'
i4jhkov,2022-04-13 01:22:05,SirClaks,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,60ml does not necessarily mean 60g due to the crema which is trapped C02 giving it a much lower density. Depending on the type of bean the roast level and how fresh the beans are youll get varying amount of crema meaning that the weight of 60ml of espresso will differ greatly.  This is why the output is weighed instead of measured volumetrically as it gives a much more accurate and consistent value for the output.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2l9cv/can_someone_help_me_understand_ratios_please/i4jhkov/'
i4jiec5,2022-04-13 01:33:52,Chapafifi,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,So a double shot never truly means a double shot? A double is technically closer to one shot  And volume is pretty close to weight considering 1 ml water = 1g of water. Give or take the density of coffee water,i4jgr03,/r/espresso/comments/u2l9cv/can_someone_help_me_understand_ratios_please/i4jiec5/'
i4jvlid,2022-04-13 04:25:43,chuckitoutbuddy,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,Where did you hear/read that 60grams out is a double shot?  A double is technically 14grams of coffee in but Espresso is much easier to dial in when using a double to triple basket. Something that can hold 16 to 20grams. And then if you use a 1:2 ratio expect 36-40 grams out.   The only way to know the weights is to use a scale before and after.   Just watch James hoffman espresso videos and forget the others for now and if you have the right equipment you can make a 18in/36out in 25-35seconds shot and then go from there.,i4jiec5,/r/espresso/comments/u2l9cv/can_someone_help_me_understand_ratios_please/i4jvlid/'
i4jjsx9,2022-04-13 01:54:02,slickmamba,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,A ‚Äúdouble‚Äù refers to the dose size not the espresso. Every 7g of ground coffee is a traditional shot. So 14g is a double 21g a triple.   Volume in ml is very close to weight(g) for coffee yes but you need to account for the crema which can easily be 50% of the volume.  James Hoffman did a video about this years ago. People have been doing weight for about a decade now.  Videos suggesting volumetric 2oz or 60ml in 25-30s are very very dated. I would suggest not watching those.,i4jiec5,/r/espresso/comments/u2l9cv/can_someone_help_me_understand_ratios_please/i4jjsx9/'
i4jvz12,2022-04-13 04:29:41,Chapafifi,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,Its literally everywhere. If you google how much is a double shot of espresso you get nearly all answers saying 60ml/2oz and half for a single shot  But I see now that this misinformation is definitely why my coffee has been so bitter and overextracted.

i4l72gz,2022-04-13 10:08:46,fatherofraptors,u2l9cv,Can someone help me understand ratios please,60ml/2fl.oz is not equal to 60 grams or 2 oz in weight. The crema portion of the espresso shot is far less dense and depending on the blend of coffee youre using and how fresh it is you can have 40g of coffee be close to 60ml of volume.,i4jvz12,/r/espresso/comments/u2l9cv/can_someone_help_me_understand_ratios_please/i4l72gz/'

A machine with a gauge like that could probably use the water tap or steam wand to bleed water out to get 4bar preinfusion and 9 bar brew.  If its a ULKA pump you can use the water flow charts and a blind/blocked basket to calibrate where 9 bar sits on the gauge.  Would be more fun that the usual boring heres a 4000 dollar machine lets nitpick on workflow issues that dont even matter if you arent a barista making 100 drinks a day,i4je230,/r/espresso/comments/u2j4ca/how_bad_is_a_35_machine_can_it_make_good_tasting/i4khj22/'

They had a coffee bar when I wanted something different but Starbucks Via was really not bad every day and was better than the dining room coffee. Also I could take it with me anywhere so even when we had an early activity I just needed water to mix it with.  Dont let a substance dependence get in the way of a fun trip. I had much more fun (and so did my wife) without letting the snobbiness control my mornings- instant coffee lets you meet your needs without having control over your routine. The alternative is taking a vacation from your caffeine habit too and when Ive done this the headache only lasted 1-2 days so Id probably just stop before going on the trip if I really didnt want to put up with the coffee situation.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2ib9b/what_to_do_when_on_a_cruise/i4joki2/'

i4izds8,2022-04-12 21:38:04,Fancy_Average_4061,u2e2rd,Atom 65 single dose conversion,I have an atom 75 other than the bellows you will need to ensure that all gaps within the grind chamber are properly sealed otherwise gounds will end up inside the body of the grinder when you press the bellows.  A major leak point is the rubber cover above the chute i had to cover it with a few layers of tape to ensure a tight fit. Youll probably need to find some way to make the space between the burr carrier and the hopper entrance airtight as well.  But do be prepared for it to still retain at least 3g of old grounds it just wasnt built for single dosing,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2e2rd/atom_65_single_dose_conversion/i4izds8/'

That‚Äôs not personal experience but I‚Äôve heard enough YouTubers and professionals all come to the same conclusion t that I believe it.

i4hqg1b,2022-04-12 15:58:04,_FormerFarmer,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,Not sure you will really see a major difference between the Atom 75 and one of the smaller burred grinders in that line.

i4hqp3w,2022-04-12 15:59:53,slickmamba,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,I would make your grinder choice based on the type of drink and roast level you prefer.  The burr design and burr options make a huge deal on how the espresso will taste(body clarity) that along with the option to use other brewing methods should play a part in your decision.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4hqp3w/'
i4hxlg6,2022-04-12 16:49:33,Eileithia,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,I have a Mignon Specialita. The set it and forget it features are great if you‚Äôre using the same beans all the time. I have mine loaded with Lavazza Rosa. Yes it‚Äôs grocery store beans but we both like the flavour profile and every-day convenience for americanos and milk drinks. It takes a micro-adjustment with each new bag and I double check the shot time to weight at the same time. The variation over 2 months has been 0.1g. Pretty f‚Äôn reliable. We go through a 1kg bag every 1-1.5 weeks.   I use a K-plus hand grinder for single-dosing specialty for espresso. And we usually have a couple bags on the go. That gets used on weekends when we have time to sit and enjoy it.   A single doser like the niche would be nice but you cant beat the convenience of a hopper if you‚Äôre not switching beans every shot. Super efficient when you have company as well.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4hxlg6/'
i4hxwct,2022-04-12 16:51:42,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,Unless you are willing to take the plunge into the single-dosing world and get the Niche I would suggest that you keep your Encore for FP and use a hopper grinder for espresso only. Switching the grind from coarse FP to fine espresso with a full hopper requires running the grinder which will waste beans and drive you crazy if you do it often.  I have both a Specialita and a Niche and the Niche is a pleasure for switching brew methods.   I use and love my Specialita for espresso only. The digital timers on the better Eureka grinders work really well. If the Atom 75 is too pricey consider the Atom 65 XL or Specialita.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4hxwct/'
i4ixoth,2022-04-12 21:22:34,ggcadc,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,I have an atom 75 big flat burrs have a flavor profile I prefer. The niche is wild as it has a fairly big conical burr and is very popular I just am not into the conical flavor profile in general.   This grinder is ‚Äúgreat for single dosing‚Äù in that it _can_ but it‚Äôs a cafe grinder with plenty of retention. This isn‚Äôt really a problem to be honest. I‚Äôve had far worse retention and purging a grinder has historically been part of my workflow. I don‚Äôt need to purge this ever but if I did it wouldn‚Äôt bother me.  I‚Äôve also owned a sette 270 in the past I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Baratza makes some great grinders the sette just had a lot of problems that my virtuoso never had.   As for day to day use the atom has excellent manners. The programmable timed dosing is useful and it super quiet (one of my priorities when looking). I make coffee while the rest of the house is sleeping so some louder options were a simple no go. The workflow is simple I‚Äôm consistently able to make very good to excellent coffee every time.  Your Bianca deserves an excellent grinder I think you‚Äôre looking in the right direction.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4ixoth/'
i4i0cra,2022-04-12 17:09:22,Possible-Surround469,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,I was going to say the same.  It comes with a hopper but you can still single dose with it quite well (I do) and if you want you can buy a 3D printer mod that makes it have a small single dose feeder with an optional bellow for 40 dollars.  With that mod your retention will be 100%,i4hp0ku,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4i0cra/'

i4hv7bf,2022-04-12 16:32:21,cosmicomics,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,So Ive never gotten the chance to compare a shot of espresso back to back between flat burrs and conical burrs so I really dont know which way I would lean there. Ive certainly had espresso from both but at different coffee shops with different coffees and espresso machines. In terms of roast level light to medium roast is what I would usually prefer. Would that make you lean towards flat or conical in and of itself?  Thanks!,i4hqp3w,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4hv7bf/'
i4hy1ps,2022-04-12 16:52:47,cosmicomics,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,Yeah I switch beans often in that its not unusual for me to go from one bag of beans to another but overall thats still more consistent than you might assume for a single dosing grinder.   Thank you especially for calling out the company aspect: while my wife doesnt drink a ton of coffee every one of our friends and family does so it would certainly get a lot more use during visits.,i4hxlg6,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4hy1ps/'
i4i4wwa,2022-04-12 17:42:15,expensive2bcheap,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,Yes very good option but for FP is better to keep the Encore also.

i4hwgps,2022-04-12 16:41:23,Apolitiks,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,Theoretically conicals produce more body and chocolate notes whereas flats produce more clarity and flavor separation but with less body. This is due to more particle uniformity in flats vs more fine particles from conicals which can give espresso a more ‚Äúblended‚Äù profile.   In reality however if you‚Äôre not comparing side by side you‚Äôll be happy with either.,i4hv7bf,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4hwgps/'
i4hz69c,2022-04-12 17:00:55,slickmamba,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,Conical vs flat is kinda outdated the burr design is more important than flat vs conical but it does tend that conicals are better for body flats better for clarity.  There are good flats for body(most espresso stock burrs like eureka) and conicals good for clarity(1zpresso k series c40 lagom mini).    The big difference is the clarity and body.  You will trade off the thick body in your shots but gain huge clarity and lose the muddiness associated with espresso focused burrs.  Its so subjective though.  The x54 I think would be a good option that gives you lots of burr options as well(baratza ceramic for body ditting steel brew burr for clarity) with the stock x54 somewhere in the middle.  Since you are coming from the encore any of these will be a huge upgrade the only concern is moving forward.  That being said plenty of people are more than happy with just their niche doing all sorts of shots but its very subjective.  Some people really dislike the niche for clarity and pourovers,i4hv7bf,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4hz69c/'
i4hyuos,2022-04-12 16:58:36,Eileithia,u2bfm0,Looking for guidance on a new grinder to accompany a Lelit Bianca,Ya if your doing a bag at a time throwing it in the hopper and dialling in is great.  You‚Äôll Probably need 3-4 shots to get both the grind and time locked in (math helps) but it‚Äôs push-button easy after that.,i4hy1ps,/r/espresso/comments/u2bfm0/looking_for_guidance_on_a_new_grinder_to/i4hyuos/'

As for the roast i do see mostly dark roasts they‚Äôll be passable (or even good) if its one of the Italian brands (when it‚Äôs Lavazza or Costadoro the grinder and machine are often decently dialed in).

Just look deeper into some reviews and a wiki and with little headache you‚Äôll find a good pair.   2- If you really want a built in grinder I‚Äôd suggest the Lelit Kate. Step-less grinder PID Cup heater 58mm filter stainless steel body shot timer Boiler (vs thermojet on the breville). I have it as my first machine and I love it. The machine can produces really nice shots. If you go for medium/light roast get ready for  a lot trials and tweaking until you a taste to your liking.   3- separate grinder is always better. Make sure to read enough and find a machine you‚Äôre convinced with. I went the combo since where I live other brands are super overpriced (even for the sage/breville).

Some people get lucky and get to use them for years without issue. If you want a Breville for cost and above its price features I cant say it isnt a great option. Just look into a stand alone grinder so if/when it goes out or use decide to move to another machine you dont lose the grinder too.  I started off on a Barista Express and pretty quickly learned I hated the grinder so I got a Niche Zero.

i4hjg6z,2022-04-12 14:56:55,SycoAniliz,u27ycp,How much grinder is too much grinder?,Too much grinder is really only limited to something you want but you wouldnt ever buy. Those two lines tend to change over time.  If you really want a grinder first set an absolute maximum youd be willing to spend not that that means you *will* spend that. Then define exactly what you want out of your grinder if price was no issue (taste workflow maintenance style size). Then find grinders in your price range and see which tick the most boxes on your list try to bring it down to 10 or less. Then of those try to rank them on least to most desirable. Starting with most desirable compare their price against what you dont like about it. If you think at its price any of those things you dont like are deal-breakers take it off the list. This should get you pretty close to a decision.   For me even with an unlimited budget there arent grinderd aside from the Niche that dont have deal-breakers of some kind be it features or value. I honestly dont care for the flavor the niche gives me but it was the only grinder more or less expensive I could see myself buying liking and enjoy using.

Any of the eurekas are fine sette niche etc. for milk drinks.  Since you are looking to change to more espresso forward milk drinks the p64 could be good but I wouldnt really consider it unless you are looking to transition to lighter roasts as well there are other options.    If you are interested in expanding just straight espresso or interested in lighter roasts the p64 is fantastic.  But it would be good to have if you ever want to expand your taste with its multiple burr options.  edit:  as for people saying a grinder is good enough or not good enough its typically in relation to its ability to brew specific types of beans or brew methods.  The niche is a great grinder for more traditional espresso but does only ok for high clarity shots that people like with lighter roasts or for filter brew methods.  Same with the sette or any of the other espresso oriented grinders.

i4h5pds,2022-04-12 13:29:19,ksl982,u27ycp,How much grinder is too much grinder?,A p64 is a fantastic grinder and will give great results but may be a bit overkill for the gaggia unless you plan to upgrade your machine in the near future then that would be a great option for jumping into endgame espresso.  The Niche will be perfectly fine and you will be able to upgrade your machine and still use this grinder though it may not present you with the same style of espresso and precision as the p64.  The sette will be fine for a gaggia and many machines you could upgrade to but not as well as the two previously mentioned grinders.  That said your current extraction seems way off for espresso a 19g dose should give you around 38g in 20-30 seconds.  This would suggest you need to grind much finer than you currenntly do and work on technique for prepping the puck and using your machine any of these grinders will allow you to do that however a P64 with your current setup and situation seems a bit overkill.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u27ycp/how_much_grinder_is_too_much_grinder/i4h5pds/'
i4iz86n,2022-04-12 21:36:38,ggcadc,u27ycp,How much grinder is too much grinder?,Imo the espresso machine matters FAR less than the grinder. A coffee machine delivers water at temp pressure at particular flow rates. That‚Äôs it. If you can get your classic temp stable then you probably won‚Äôt taste a difference between that and any other machine.  A grinder however has a massive impact on flavor and the ability to consistently perform a routine. Not that they have to be expensive to be excellent but it certainly increases the odds.  Edit: for this purchase to make sense you probably should ensure you‚Äôre getting proper flow temps and pressure from your machine.

i4i4s2f,2022-04-12 17:41:18,slickmamba,u27ycp,How much grinder is too much grinder?,Yeah without a consistent grinder and machine it makes it hard especially when you are working on your puck prep the bottomless will help alot in this process.  Honestly I would really suggest adding a PID/gagguino sooner than later to your gaggia for temp stability as well since temp surfing kinda sucks I did it for 2 years with my gaggia before I added a PID.  you can add the dimmer mod down the line as well for some flow control.  If money isnt a problem I would even consider selling the gaggia and getting a more consistent machine.    Sounds like youre still early in the process but if money isnt an issue the p64 is a great grinder that youll never have to upgrade from but I think youll be happy with any of the other grinders too(sette eureka line niche etc).  If you want to explore more light roasts and 100% want to continue the journey p64 is great but you could also just do a df64,i4i1tsa,/r/espresso/comments/u27ycp/how_much_grinder_is_too_much_grinder/i4i4s2f/'

i4hn5yj,2022-04-12 15:33:26,ksl982,u27ycp,How much grinder is too much grinder?,Then a P64 or another endgame grinder might be a good choice for you. However you could also consider getting two really decent grinders with different burr styles instead of a P64: like a niche (conical) and a eureka mignon(flat). This would allow you to better understand which burr you prefer instead of investing all that money in a flat burr grinder and realizing you prefer the body of the conical burrs over the clarity of flat burrs. Also these should other grinders will still be usable after upgrading your machine and will help you understand more about what you‚Äôre looking for in a grinder from burr perspective as well as workflow and daily use/maintenance. One last thing it‚Äôs pretty difficult to use espresso grinds from a local roaster/cafe since they aren‚Äôt dialed in for your machine it would be easier if you got a hand grinder for around $200 in the meantime to grind yourself and understand the grind size and how to use the machine.

You do need fresh coffee but you need to be able to dial it in to a desired extraction/yield for a given dose/ratio. Once the grind size is close even minor adjustments can make a noticeable difference. Its not recommended to get pre-ground coffee because its not fresh and you lose control of probably the most important variable which is grind size.   I think the P64 would be a great option.

i4hmh8g,2022-04-12 15:27:12,leitan42,u26u5s,WDT,Seriously WDT is the Weiss Distribution Technique. Its using a kind of tool to improve your coffee grinds distribution.   In the words of the OG RapidCoffee aka John Weiss:  I started to get serious about espresso in 2005. The bottomless portafilter had just been introduced and folks like Jon Rosenthal were publishing wonderful espresso porn photos on CoffeeGeek. My early efforts in that direction were pretty bad for a variety of reasons. After trying a number of ways to improve my extractions I stumbled upon Chris Tacys blog in which he emphasized the importance of grinds distribution in the puck: Distribution is the most misunderstood neglected and really critical variable within your control.  So I began experimenting with ways to improve distribution. At the time the general focus was on grooming techniques (like Stockfleths) and tamping (like Staub). But these methods only impact the surface of the puck and did not help much. Eventually I decided to try stirring the grinds. This made a mess on the counter so I added a basket collar (or funnel). And so WDT was born.  Here are some things that WDT cannot do: * improve poor coffee * compensate for a deficient grinder * compensate for an inadequate espresso machine  Here is what WDT can do: * break up clumps in the coffee grinds * ensure even distribution of coffee grinds in the puck  Is WDT necessary? Of course not! If your grinder produces clump-free evenly distributed coffee grinds in the basket WDT is superfluous. But if not theres a good chance that WDT will improve your extractions. Are there alternate techniques? Of course there are. For example some people prefer to dose into a cup and shake up the grinds before transferring them to the basket. This seems to work. However I remain skeptical of any distribution tool that only impacts the surface of the puck. For espresso I use a grinder (dosered Robur) that is unlikely to require grinds redistribution. However I still apply WDT to every puck using a cant hurt and might help approach. When I stagger downstairs for my first cup of coffee in the morning its easy enough to screw up. A few extra seconds to guarantee good puck prep - and thats really all it takes - seems well worth it to me. WDT is fast simple and effective. My advice: try not to overcomplicate matters. Theres no magic stirring pattern stirring speed or number of stirs. Use an implement that is easy to hold and has relatively thin wires. You can make your own or purchase a dissecting needle (one wire) or keycap puller (4 wires) for under $10. As Ive stated on many other occasions I do not recommend chopsticks/skewers (too fat) or paper clips (poor ergonomics).  If it helps great. If not dont use it. Simple as that. https://www.home-barista.com/tips/how-necessary-is-wdt-t65542-10.html#19,-,/r/espresso/comments/u26u5s/wdt/i4hmh8g/'

i4ggm8q,2022-04-12 10:51:50,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u24e81,Really struggling with the delonghi specialista maestro,Most of the espresso advice you will find online pertains to non-pressurized machines while the Specialista is pressurized. This makes it much less sensitive to grind changes.  If you can figure out how to manually limit the shot yield then you can experiment with different combinations of dose grind and yield that give you the best shot. 20g sounds like a large dose for the machine you might want to go down to 16-18g. To correct for sourness reducing the dose increasing the yield or grinding finer may help.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u24e81/really_struggling_with_the_delonghi_specialista/i4ggm8q/'

What youre really paying for with an expensive commercial machine is consistency-- that $20k commercial machine probably doesnt make coffee any better than a $2k prosumer machine it can just make dozens of them per hour with consistent results.

It will not last long when grinder regularly at espresso settings. The better comparison would be the DF64.  - noise. The lagom is extremely quiet. With a newborn in the house grinder noise can be the difference between having coffee and not having coffee. I upgraded from the Sette 270‚Ä¶ - longevity. The motor and grinding mechanisms are premium. The grinder should last an extremely long time.  - alignment. Much less likely to have alignment issues on the lagom than something cheaper like the DF64. I want to take advantage of the various burr options and swap them out a few times a year and I don‚Äôt want the headache of dealing with alignment for the next 10-20 years.  - long-term value. I‚Äôm spending more now but expect that over 20+ years it will be a better value compared to purchasing and replacing multiple cheaper grinders.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u23go2/why_endgame_grinders/i4gbs3n/'

i4gbocp,2022-04-12 10:21:22,Rashkh,u23go2,Why ‚Äúendgame‚Äù grinders?,There can be many reasons someone might want one. Below are mine:  - **Buy once cry once:** If youre someone whos prone to upgrading your gear and I certainly am then you may end up spending thousands on upgrades while working your way up the quality ladder. Going for the top end right off the bat cuts that cycle off. I havent felt the need to upgrade my grinder since Ive gotten it. - **Durability:** This ties into the first point but all of the high end grinders are built like tanks. If this is going to be your last grinder then you want to make sure you dont need another one after buying it. - **Aesthetics:** This plays a role for many people. People like nice stuff and many of the high end grinders are very pretty. Its the same reason people get things like wooden portafilter handles. Using something that looks and feels nice can elevate your experience. The Lagom and Weber buyers would fit here. - **Grind quality:** This doesnt actually apply to me. I know that I can get 90% of the performance for like 50% of the price but I fall into the aesthetics camp. The people who want top end grind quality to extract every last drop of goodness typically care less about aesthetics. The Kafatek buyers would probably go here. Im not saying it isnt a nice machine but I dont think that how it looks is why people buy it. - **One grinder to do it all:** This was another big reason for me. Its nice not to have two grinders on the countertop for espresso/drip especially if you have limited space in the kitchen. Most of the grinders that can do both well are in the top end. It also somewhat justifies the higher price. - **Value of money:** I dont fit in here either but some people make a ton of money and to them there isnt a huge distinction between $500 and $5000 so they just top out at the start.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u23go2/why_endgame_grinders/i4gbocp/'

Quality aside then it depends on what you need/want from it (and how much you‚Äôre willing to spend) - I personally would not feel I need more than the Niche if I had to go for an electric grinder and a lot of espresso enthusiasts swear by it. The P64 is definitely an amazing machine though and at an amazing pricepoint when compared head to head with other end game grinders (as compared by JH).

i4gbkov,2022-04-12 10:20:45,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u226nu,First Machine- Nespresso Latissma Pro or Breville Barista Express/Pro,Espresso machines have to deal with a combination of electricity water under high pressure and steam. This combo is very difficult to manage. As a result the machines that you are considering may not meet your definition of good machine that I can use for the next few years. They are more like disposable appliances.  If you want a machine that can be self-repaired and will last a long time with proper care and maintenance you might want to consider Gaggia Classic Pro or Rancilio Silvia. For a grinder consider the Eureka Mignon series which have better build quality than Baratza.  Keep in mind that using a semi-auto espresso machine has a steep learning curve. You need to be willing to treat home espresso as a hobby not just a coffee maker. If you put in the effort you will be rewarded with great espresso that is as good quality as you can get at the best cafes. If this doesnt sound like your idea of a good time then go for Nespresso or a super-auto machine.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u226nu/first_machine_nespresso_latissma_pro_or_breville/i4gbkov/'

Please help!!!,Are they actually aiming for those parameters or is that just what they are? Its surprisingly common for espresso businesses to do well despite not knowing how to make espresso.   I have also often seen the situation where an espresso business in their early days makes espresso without ever measuring or adjusting anything but they do well because their milk drinks and syrups are good or whatever. Then as they expand they decide their random espresso parameters are in fact their secret recipe and codify them not out of any novel theory of espresso just because thats the way theyve always done it. Theres an inexplicably popular regional drive thru chain near me that does 8:1 ratios now checked and measured with scales and spot checked by the owners but which Im almost certain is simply reflective of the size of the shot glasses they happened to buy at their first shop and the baskets that came with their first machine.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u21aab/i_work_at_a_local_coffee_shop_and_after_reading/i4gvf93/'

Id typically also leave a review on google-maps informing others that this is not a place to come if one is interested in specialty espresso.  If youd like your shots to taste well you need to push the extraction time to 25 sec at the minimum best starting with 1:2 (input:output) ratio. In case you have a light roast you typically start with 30 sec at the least.  I see others are commenting on what your boss says etc. My answer concerns your question about your recipe.

They‚Äôre delicious when used with light roasts. As you no doubt already know light roasts are harder to extract needing higher ratios and flow rates to do so properly. This is the main reason why flow control is so useful it allows us to get well-extracted shots from light roasted beans. I would not use this type of shot for darker roasted beans however that would very likely give a hugely over-extracted shot. It depends on the beans you are using as to whether a turbo shot is the right approach.,i4h2ieb,/r/espresso/comments/u21aab/i_work_at_a_local_coffee_shop_and_after_reading/i4hh29v/'

Please help!!!,I havent tried any because I just cant imagine that a short extraction with light roasts would work) typically they need longer exactly for the reasons you mention (I actuality only use light roasts and most need 32-35 sec to get the right sweetness and balance). With anything less than 30 sec you typically get a salty flavor which is a sign of underextraction. When that paper came out virtually every experimental result Ive seen complained about the body and fullness of the shot.,i4hh29v,/r/espresso/comments/u21aab/i_work_at_a_local_coffee_shop_and_after_reading/i4hkwvw/'

Please help!!!,What does high quality mean?  plenty of coffee professionals and people deep into espresso who are pushing the edge of extraction and taste do turbos.  It would likely be not satisfactory to those who likely drink med-darker roasts in standard 1:2 but anyone who loves light roasts should try turbos if they havent.   I think youll be fairly surprised when you try it with your decent.  You can do it now with your brewtus but it will be harder without flow control.      As for extraction Im not sure if you read the paper but you can get high extraction with increased flow rate.  Time isnt actually that large of a factor.  Higher ratios faster flow rates increased extraction.  Try a 1:2.5 or 1:3 turbo,i4hdggz,/r/espresso/comments/u21aab/i_work_at_a_local_coffee_shop_and_after_reading/i4hpdqy/'

Please help!!!,You‚Äôre right - unless you grind more coarsely you do need to run them longer. Another way to extract at the same level is to hit the puck with a high flow rate for a shorter amount of time. If you‚Äôre able to play with flow rates I‚Äôd recommend adjusting your grind so you end up with something around 4ml/s at the end of the the shot. It seems highly counter-intuitive but worth a try! This type of shot is great at bringing out fruit sweetness and clarity but the compromise is you absolutely lose body and texture. It may not be for you but I‚Äôd try it at least once if you can.,i4hkwvw,/r/espresso/comments/u21aab/i_work_at_a_local_coffee_shop_and_after_reading/i4hleg8/'

Please help!!!,By high quality I mean espresso that conforms to the standards of specialty coffee as served in specialty coffee bars) there are indeed many different drinks served and tried out but Ive never seen a specialty place recommend let alone serve that kind of shot. How possibly could a light roast with high acidity be anything but underextracted with that flow rate if it is typically repulsive and underextracted in a flow rate that does 1:2 in say 25 sec. So since espresso is indeed all about the flow rate I dont see a reason to even try that kind of recipe) in addition light roast without a decent body (but merely clarity) is not something I find particularly appealing.,i4hpdqy,/r/espresso/comments/u21aab/i_work_at_a_local_coffee_shop_and_after_reading/i4jecr0/'

All the power to you tho hopefully you‚Äôll at least give it a shot when you get your decent.

Please help!!!,Right I saw those but thats just a different drink not an espresso. It reminds me of all kinds of attempts to make a raw pizza and while sure we can call it a pizza its just not what one expects from a pizza ) Given that espresso is a short drink I find it important that the central features are preserved and maxed out rather than compromised. Compromising on one value (body fullness) to push another (clarity) in extreme is simply making a different drink. I dont think it makes sense to try that with a 9 bar machine: youd get a white gusher and Ive had plenty of those when dialing in new beans. Perhaps with a different flow rate but still Im in doubt its more than an experiment by people as you suggest whod got inspired to play around in view of that paper. I remember Hoffmans video on that kind of shot and it didnt seem very convincing) in any case if a bar decides to serve that they better not sell it as a standard espresso but then just call it turbo same as we dont call Americano espresso.,i4jfo84,/r/espresso/comments/u21aab/i_work_at_a_local_coffee_shop_and_after_reading/i4jg6xq/'

I really love the stainless steel handle of our whisker solution . The only downside is that it‚Äôs not possible to have the needles (which again I greatly encourage you to buy ) pointing outward .  Only way to achieve that is either by bending the needles themselves and perhaps fixing them in place with a bit of soldering  or drill oriented holes which would be a bit too much . For now I have done neither  since just the acupuncture needles are already enough in my opinion and I don‚Äôt have any channeling most of the time .,i4fec9u,/r/espresso/comments/u1z2sz/we_doing_shitty_wdts_unused_whisk_i_cut_down/i4fggwh/'

i4vnmd5,2022-04-15 14:00:03,cjdavia,u1y26i,Espresso with inexpensive Breville Cafe Roma,Hi there.  It can make a difference yes. It can also make some really rotten stuff too.  Be warned once you start this you‚Äôll be joining me down a long rabbit hole.  Not that you asked but here is my story.   First of all you need fresh beans. And then you need a really good grinder. To be honest I thought the need for a good grinder was complete BS. I have an inexpensive cuisinart burr grinder that I thought should work‚Ä¶ well it didn‚Äôt. The coffee came out absolutely shitty. So. Many. Shitty. Attempts.  So I started looking around for a new grinder.  These things are so pricey!  I finally settled on a K-pro hand grinder. After testing different grind sizes and making many many more shitty espressos and careful tamping I finally dialed it for this one.   The problem was that only like 1 outta 5 would come out good.  After many more shitty espressos I decided it is probably because the Roma‚Äôs cheap tamper was a little small for the basket.  So I purchased an aftermarket tamper as well. I started using a toothpick as a WTD and to level things and break up the clumps.   Now maybe 3 or 4 out of 5 come out decent.  I think the pump on the Roma is not very consistent and the temperature control is also not very consistent so things constantly change. If you decide to go down this road take lots of notes and try to have fun experimenting. Don‚Äôt drink everything you make!    I have learned a lot from this experiment and believe these skills are transferable to other machines.   Update: using dark roasted coffee I had good results setting the K-Pro to 3.4 grinding 15g of beans and ruining about 35 seconds for a 40g yield.   Long story short - after a week of tinkering I decided to get a cafelat robot espresso machine.  I will be able to better control the temperature and pressure. Go figure.

I lack a good grinder so I think I will have to sort that out before switching the basket. It‚Äôs endless though because eventually I will have to upgrade to a better/proper espresso machine.

The 3rd bag of beans resolved the issue hasnt been a problem since.    If youre cleaning the grouphead on a regular basis and removing the shower screen to soak be mindful to inspect the gasket for tears from pulling it out and just wear and tear in general.  Ive found that they will last about a year if youre daily driving the machine but could be replaced sooner due to removal damage.

i4fj1jz,2022-04-12 07:20:01,wild_minimalist,u1nws5,Slayer shots on machines besides BDB?,Honestly I dont know why it is so expensive in Canada. In the US the R Nine One retails for $6500 so the R Nine One should only be about 8k CAD. Im guessing there are some insane tariffs and customs fees in Canada that account for the increase.   Anyway I am getting close to buying my forever espresso machine and I thought about the features that I wanted:   * Pressure profiling * Saturated grouphead  * Big ass steam boiler  * The ability to manually profile a shot with a lever * The ability to automatically profile a shot with an automated recipe  * Aesthetically I lean towards classic e61 bodies with lots of guages levers and lots of shiny stainless steel  Anyway given my wishlist there arent too many machines out there to evaluate. My short list included:   * LM GS3 MP - I eliminated this option because there are no programmed pressure profiles and the paddle looks extremely sensitive. Like if you look at videos of people trying to profile a shot they are holding the paddle with both hands making a miniscule adjustment and seeing the pressure go from 3 bar to 7 bar.  * Slayer - Slayer people love slayers that much is obvious. But the slayer was not actually designed as a pressure profiling machine. It has an opinion on preinfusion and yes that is a profile but in terms of going for different recipes that is not what the machine is designed for.  * Decent - This was the closest competitor. I might regret not going with decent just because of the quality of their software. But the machine doesnt meet my aesthetic or haptic requirements of being able to manually profile a shot. I dont want to pull espresso with a computer. I feel like in the future if I ever have an office again I might have a decent at work because it does seem like a hands-down winner when it comes to UI and their approach to sharing profiles etc.  * Lots of other top-tier machines - Della Corte Mina VA Prima - They were always missing something -some had no saturated group others had weird gimmicks like auto steam wands no stored pressure profiles there was always something.    Now this wasnt part of my wish list but what really got me with the R Nine One was the fact that it doesnt rely on a valve to adjust pressure/flow. Rather the pump pressure actually changes. Whether a machine uses a conical valve or a solenoid valve to adjust pressure you still are restricting water flow to change pressure. Im fascinated by the idea of maintaining a constant flow rate while changing the actual pressure of the pump.   When I put all of these factors together I am leaning towards the R Nine One. Nobody has been able to convince me otherwise. But its such a major decision Im not rushing into anything.,i4fd4ji,/r/espresso/comments/u1nws5/slayer_shots_on_machines_besides_bdb/i4fj1jz/'

i4ftsa6,2022-04-12 08:30:14,rbpx,u1nws5,Slayer shots on machines besides BDB?,>When I put all of these factors together I am leaning towards the R Nine One.  Well I certainly get this. Imagine finally getting a decent (sry) saturated head and yet still having pressure profiling. Thats epic. You dont need more machine than this (if it records and lets you replay a profile - automation is a good thing (thank you Martha)).  The Decent. Yeah Ive looked at this as the machine to have even though it sounds like a robot getting sick on your carpet as it runs... but one wee idea keeps concerning me: its a great machine for setting up ***first*** and then ***replaying*** a recorded profile. Its never demod as the machine you want to run dynamically hands on. Id really like to see a video of someone doing this.  I couldnt afford a Large Dual Boiler with Flow Control so I settled for a good quality HX with Flow Control ***rather*** than go with a Small Dual Boiler ***without*** Flow Control. For me this was the right decision. I ***really*** enjoy the hands on of the profiling of the shot. I know now that Id love to have a Lever. However I dont ***always*** want to futz around. Sometimes I just want a coffee. Thus the perfect machine for me would have full recording/playback profiling automation but it would also have great manual controls too. This R Nine One seems to have both. Except for its astronomical price it just flat out looks amazing (both aesthetically and functionally). Again Id need to know more about whether it can or how it can  automate profiling.  Re: Pressure vs Flow profiling. This system is not unlike a simple resistive electrical circuit albeit where the resistance of the load decreases over the shot. That is weve either got a voltage (pressure) source or a current (flow) source. What this means is when the resistance changes what changes with it? The Pressure or the Flow? The one that does NOT change is the kind of source you have. Eg. If you have a voltage (pressure) source then that will hold steady and change the current (flow) to address the change in the (puck) resistance.  Thus I think you really want full control over the Flow not the Pressure. The pressure can change (within limits) to whatever it needs to be to support the flow you want. To get the coffee extraction you want you must control the amount of time the water is in contact and this means you want to control the Flow.  Even though the Flow Control on my Profitec is a crude screw-type needle valve which is non-linear and has 2.25 full turns from open to close it directly controls the physical parameter which determines the taste I get in my cup. I think people imagine that Pressure Profiling is great because thats the physical aspect you directly control with a Lever and Levers are traditional and great no?  In other words either will work fine and either can be fun - which is kinda what were after together with great coffee. As Decent has shown (in their videos and all those cool graphs) is you want to control/track FLOW in order to control extraction. Of course you also have to be able to generate the necessary pressure in order to get that flow so you cant cheap out by greatly reducing the puck resistance (grinding coarser!) in order to make 2 or 4bar shots. No no no. I personally like 8bar shots (as measured at the brewhead by the puck) and even 6bar shots (but thats pushing it).  So its my guess that either Pressure or Flow Profiling would work fine - but itd be so cool to have both. Wait... does this take me back to the Decent again?  The R Nine One looks gorgeous. It sounds amazing. Let us know if/when you pull the trigger!,i4fj1jz,/r/espresso/comments/u1nws5/slayer_shots_on_machines_besides_bdb/i4ftsa6/'
i4g2823,2022-04-12 09:23:11,mattmonkey24,u1nws5,Slayer shots on machines besides BDB?,>Im fascinated by the idea of maintaining a constant flow rate while changing the actual pressure of the pump.   Pressure is an output from the flow of water through the resistor (coffee puck). Since the resistor is more/less constant (or rather its going to do its own thing and degrade over time) youre really playing with flow. You cant have low flow and high pressure. Or high flow with low pressure.  I dont believe its possible to have a constant flow rate with varying pressure.  This is a big strength of the Decent. It makes parameters very intuitive and it forces you to learn whats really going on. It can make you a better barista through that,i4fj1jz,/r/espresso/comments/u1nws5/slayer_shots_on_machines_besides_bdb/i4g2823/'

Many people in the forums arent even aware that this feature of the controller exists. But theres no easy way to record it and then have it repeat.  Really the UI and the machine controls arent great for this workflow. You really need to be onboard with setting up the shot first and then letting it go.

i4g5bx1,2022-04-12 09:42:14,wild_minimalist,u1nws5,Slayer shots on machines besides BDB?,>Again Id need to know more about whether it can or how it can  automate profiling.   There are two ways the R Nine One does this:   1. The machine has five stored profiles which you can customize. Each profile is made of up to five intervals. Each interval has a duration and a pressure. You could set a profile to have 1 super long interval or five that add up to your target duration. But the intervals are always time-based and not volume based (which would be interesting/awesome).  2. After you pull a manual shot using the main knob/lever to profile your shot you can press the star icon on the touch screen to save that profile to the manual slot. When you select the manual slot it will play back the profile exactly as you pulled it.   I anticipate my workflow would be something like this:   1. Dial in a new coffee using a standard recipe (7 seconds at 4 bar 23 seconds at 9 bar) to establish a baseline for grind size. 2. Pull manual shots to play around with flavor profile until I find a recipe that I like.  3. Instead of saving the manual profile I will probably overwrite one of the five presets so I can get very specific with the intervals and pressures.   One interesting thing is that as you pull a manual shot it does display the flow rate at the group head on the screen. So you do have the ability to measure flow rate in some capacity.   In terms of cost it is obviously hard to justify besides considering that this is the end-state. You can waste a lot of money by upgrading every two years over the course of a decade. There is the age old logic that if you buy a $5 coffee every day assuming a $7500 investment (machine + water filtration + cost to plumb machine + accessories) it will take about 4 years to pay for itself.   With proper maintenance and good water quality I should be able to pass this machine down to my kids and in that sense its a pretty solid investment.,i4ftsa6,/r/espresso/comments/u1nws5/slayer_shots_on_machines_besides_bdb/i4g5bx1/'

i4l9fe1,2022-04-13 10:23:56,rbpx,u1nws5,Slayer shots on machines besides BDB?,The quick answer is yes. The slightly longer answer is but Im too lazy to do it every time and it requires a specific grinder setting.  A slayer shot to me is a 2 part profile. The first part is poured at a (very restricted) 1.3 to 2.0 g/s Flow Rate for about half the time (usually around 20 to 25 seconds) all followed by a full 9bars for the equal/remaining time (another 23 to 27 seconds).   How well this profile works depends on things like the beans youre using. However I found some difficulty at first. I was experiencing the mud pack effect where the puck turns into cement and strangles the water flow. It wasnt until I saw a John Buckman video where he explained youre doing it wrong that I found the problem and fixed it.  He explained the physics of extraction and espresso. When water comes in contact with the puck it starts to extract tiny coffee particles into the water. This action strips away coffee from the puck and is why the puck resistance decreases over the shot (yeah the puck is disintegrating a bit as it loses coffee to the drink).   The *problem* *with preinfusion* however is that you dont get the water into contact with ALL of the coffee for the same amount of time. Think about it. If you turn on the pour and its 5 seconds before you see the first drip then you know this: the bottom of the puck has just met the water and the top of the puck has been soaking for 5 seconds. This leads to over-extracting the top of the puck and under-extracting the bottom of the puck. This was why the mud pack was happening. I had destroyed the integrity of the puck and made a muddy soup out of the top portion of the puck.  I had all but given up until John explained: hit the puck with the full 9bars in order to start with compressing the puck to give it maximum integral strength then back off on the flow. Bingo! That worked like a charm.  Thinking back on it: maybe my puck prep wasnt good enough. Maybe I used too high a flow (2.5 to 3.0 instead of 1.3 - 2.0). Maybe my medium beans werent a good candidate for this. However after starting with a quick blast of full flow then backing off to \~2.0 g/s I had no further problems.  However the physics of the machines are the same so I assume I get the same results. Its a needle valve in both machines. However in order to do the slayer shot (or my modified slayer shot) I have adjust the grinder just for that specific setup. That is I would have to do the slayer shot **every time** or else **keep adjusting/dialing-in** my grind for slayer-shot / non-profiled shot. I dont bother with this right now. Currently Im cycling thru 18g espresso 20g Americano and 20g lattes. I set the grinder for 18:36 in 27s and use a simple 8bar flow (yeah the needle valve give me a FLOW and the company gives me a PRESSURE gauge on the brewhead as feedback... sigh) and wane the pressure/flow at the back end of the shot. I dont bother constantly dialing in the grinder. I leave it set for the 18g espresso. I can fudge the pour a bit for the 20g shots by opening up the Flow Control a bit (and it doesnt matter so much for Americanos and Lattes).,i4is4nf,/r/espresso/comments/u1nws5/slayer_shots_on_machines_besides_bdb/i4l9fe1/'

Either It didnt work for us means it didnt sell or... there are issues. Eek!  I believe the CREM ONE is a classic E61 design (so no. I think a saturated head is technically vastly superior to an E61. I read so often that people report the temperature wandering on an E61 due to wind currents or radiation loss in the room... What? InAnyCase a brewhead needs all the help it can get).  Also and Im not happy reporting this: I believe that while the CREM is Spanish designed it is Made In China. Dunno what this means.

i4d7hbu,2022-04-11 17:46:15,Anderz,u1lwhx,Using IMS basket,Yes. Stock baskets have inconsistent hole sizes normally meaning many are too small/not punctured properly.

Something could eventually come up if this isn‚Äôt an immediate need in your business. I would look for an e61 machine any brand or a miracle in your price range. This subreddit makes me believe in miracles sometimes and keep looking.   I‚Äôm going to give unsolicited advice so here it goes: I haven‚Äôt seen an espresso grinder by ditting and I don‚Äôt think the grinder you have will be able to make fine enough incremental changes to really dial in your grinder. Their batch coffee grinders are great. If I‚Äôm wrong about Ditting please link me to it because I want to see it.   More unsolicited advice: generally consider what power or water lines you have available and search for how easily replacing parts will be if you buy a used machine.

So the grinder we use is not a ditting it just uses the their 80mm burr set.    It‚Äôs a Mahlkonig Tanzania it‚Äôs definitely  more meant for grinding full bags or batch filter. It is however stepless and completely capable of espresso we‚Äôve dialled it in multiple times for espresso on an e61 group & a nuova simonelli Appia 2.

Its a hobby theres always gonna be other things you can get into. Or maybe a small quality of life upgrade that can spend up to hundreds of dollars on. But if youre happy with your setup then theres no need to. Theres always gonna be an upgradeitis.   I was rocking a gaggia classic pro and a 270 for a few months. I didnt like temp surfing so I added a PID. Then the 270 was too loud for my sleeping family so I sold it and bought a specialita for the slight increase in build quality and quieter sounds. Everything else was just a small quality of life upgrade or upgradeitis. I ended up getting a bunch of mods for the gaggia and a niche lol.

To do that you will have to spend well into 4 figures for an end-game grinder.  If it were me Id add a PID.

I did the Auber kit and it was well thought out and easy to install with very clear instructions.   I don‚Äôt expect you‚Äôll notice much of an improvement in anything but noise and maybe build quality going to the niche though. The sette is already very low retention and plenty easy to dial in.

At the end of the day the machine is just a pressurized water pump. As they get more expensive they just get a little more customizable but you can pull great shots with 9 bars consistent. I would upgrade pid first as its way less of a headache than temp surfing. If you really have you upgrade Id ugrade grinder over a machine as theyre less expensive too.

The dimmer will never be precise so just going for about repeatable. Immediately after click to turn on the dimmer my portafilter pressure gauge says Im at about 2bar.

i4cc1qi,2022-04-11 14:04:53,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u1h48g,Do I need very high end machines if Im primarily interested in milk based espresso drinks?,The Bambino is a great way to get started. It comes with both pressurized (Breville calls them dual wall) and unpressurized (single wall) filter baskets. The pressurized basket will work with most burr grinders including the Encore. Its very easy to dial in. The downside is that the quality of the espresso it produces is very limited.  Once you make the step up to unpressurized you need a proper espresso grinder and the Encore wont be good enough. Frequently recommended espresso grinders include 1ZPresso JX Pro (hand) or Eureka Mignon Notte/Manuale (electric). Dialing in becomes a much more finicky process - your dose and grind setting have to be 1000% perfect to get a good shot. But once you are there your reward will be a great tasting shot that will rival what you can get at any cafe.  Regarding the Appartamento: although it is still very popular it is a dated design and is not worth its price tag. There are lower price options (Breville Dual Boiler Lelit Elizabeth Rancilio Silvia Pro-X Profitec Pro 300) that are much better choices for most people.  Machines are not the only thing us espresso fanatics spend big bucks on. Grinders are the other thing. The grinder is much more important than the machine.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u1h48g/do_i_need_very_high_end_machines_if_im_primarily/i4cc1qi/'

My old Saeco was fine but I wanted a dual boiler and something commercial style. I bought a Gaggia first snd that didn‚Äôt work for me.  General consensus is that the Rocket Apartmento is an older design with a premium for the brand. Every retailer I visited steered me away from Rocket. In general there are enough entry levels DBs to stay away from expensive HX machines.  A better competitor and the most cost effective HX would be the MaraX.   As for the expense no regret tbh.

I notice that I seem to have an easy time brewing good tasting coffee from medium and dark roasts in my Bambino for example Blue Bottle Bold or La Colombe Nizza. But beans ground for espresso that people tend to review highly like Partners Elevate and Panther Coffee espresso blend are much  harder to dial in for me and have a strong citrus-y taste bordering on sour which I find sometimes unpleasant. The Panther especially--I cannot seem to get a decent shot out of it. The sourness is present even when I grind so fine the shot barely dribbles out. I cant tell if this is how the coffee is supposed to taste.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u1eoxa/simple_questions_thread/i4ivuam/'

Ive found a Quick Mill Anita (not the new Evo model) for around $900 I see the newer model is roughly $1600 and has been compared to the rocket apartmento In some reviews.   1. Does any have any experience with this coffee machine good or bad?  2. Given it is likely been used for many many years would you consider buying it and if so at what price would be considered a good deal?   We currently have a delonghi a la specalista but ive grown to hate it with its pressurized basket and inability to pull a enjoyable shot. My wife still loves it but I end up using the chemex with our encore more often than not.

Roast level is a spectrum - espresso roast is traditionally on the darker end of that but theres no hard standard to define roast level (on a consumer level) and every roaster will have their own sense of whats good on filter whats omni whats good for espresso. One roasters espresso roast may be darker than anothers medium. Light roasts from macro roasters you find in grocery stores are usually fairly dark.

i4ijeaa,2022-04-12 19:25:28,LightTheRidening,u1eoxa,Simple Questions Thread,I have a Bambino Plus and exactly the same thing happens.  As a grouphead operates at high pressure it stands to reason with some machines that if the pump turns off there is still a complete air seal behind the water. And without any air to come in to replace the water to fill the space in the portafilter the water cannot flow out - effectively held up by a vacuum. Air cant flow up through the tiny holes either as they are blocked by a combination of water gravity and surface tension.  You can see a similar effect if you allow a glass to completely fill up underwater and then invert it and lift it up half-way out again: the water stays in the glass and cannot flow out simply because theres no air available to replace it.,i4h0ahy,/r/espresso/comments/u1eoxa/simple_questions_thread/i4ijeaa/'

Formulas that rely on ml are older and more likely to be related to traditional espresso (eg. the Istituto Nazionale Espresso Italiano rule of 14g / 25 ml / 25 sec for a double with strict temp and pressure parameters as well).

Your grinder may have retention issues so when you change grind size you get some of the old grind size mixed with the new grind size. Try purging a few grams of beans when you switch grind sizes and see if that helps. It could also have grind size inconsistencies. 2. It could also be that your distribution is inconsistent. A toothpick is a step in the right direction but its too thick as a WDT tool. If you can pick one up from Etsy or Amazon. Dont bother getting an expensive one the cheap ones do the same thing.

i4d9kwe,2022-04-11 18:01:51,Fadedcamo,u1e7y7,I dont understand the consistency of my shots help please!,Honestly with the setup you have its going to be difficult to get consistent shots. I had a similar setup as you. I had the Smart Grinder Pro which is I believe the same grinder thats integrated into your machine. My espresso machine is a standalone called a Gaggia Classic. When I started I was frustrated like you because I had trouble with consistency in my shots. Pulling shots back to back I would weigh the shots coming out on the portafilter (I didnt bother weighing the amount I put in the grinder it isnt good for retention at all) and have some shots take longer or shorter to come out and the flavor profile be somewhat different. Not much I could do with the stock set up to alter it. Some things I did to help was to:  Have the espresso machine on for like half hour/40 minutes before I need it. This warms everything up in the internals and makes the temperature more consistent.   Try to store my beans in a decent airtight container. Beans will degrade quickly if not stored in a vacuumed dark container. This will affect the extraction. I use something like this:   https://www.williams-sonoma.com/m/products/fellow-atmos-coffee-canister/?cm_cat=Google&sku=3549071&catalogId=79&cm_ite=3549071_14571727863&gclid=CjwKCAjwo8-SBhAlEiwAopc9W3Nrx5mmTnDDL9k1XBWXSPkR7rrYhBIu7GpX1l8bLUCzDXpgrf9HjRoC_8gQAvD_BwE&cm_ven=PLA&cm_pla=Electrics%20%3e%20Coffee%20%26%20Espresso%20Accessories   Make sure to wipe the shower head and portafilter in between shots. You want the grime of the beans off the showerhead and to make sure the portafilter and the basket is completely dry. If its still wet when you put ground coffee in the basket and it gets soaked it can alter the extraction process.     Even doing these things I still observed some variation in espresso shots. Different beans were worse and some beans I simply could not get the right extraction settings with this setup. I made do and just stuck to a grind with a certain bean and make milk drinks to mask the differences in espresso shots.   But I did some mods to my machine which drastically improved my shot stability. First I adjusted the pressure in the machine to 9 bar at the output. I also got a silicone gasket at the group head. And another small mod I did was get a new group head that was made with a different material to retain much more of the heat.   But the biggest mod by far that saw a night and day fix to my shot stability was a PID. This is basically a way for the Gaggia to instead of using a basic thermostat to control temperature it uses a complex algorithm to make temperature much much more stable. I think this is the biggest issue you are having because with a basic single boiler without a PID the temperatures of water coming out of the group head can swing pretty wildly up to 10 degrees before and during shit extraction. Im not sure how to fix this with your particular unit maybe someone else with the Breville/Sage can chime in.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u1e7y7/i_dont_understand_the_consistency_of_my_shots/i4d9kwe/'

So the temperature should be good. In the last days since I got it I also try and try again for 2-3 hours so the shots after 30 minutes should be consistent but they arent.  How do you use your machine if its not consistent? If its always pure coincidence if my shot tastes good or is awful it would be a really bad experience.

I open and slap the hopper lid closed to push air through and get everything out while it‚Äôs grinding.

i4c22yy,2022-04-11 13:01:28,ManicSatanic666,u1e7y7,I dont understand the consistency of my shots help please!,OK perfect I have now a few steps I will change in my procedure. 1. weigh the beans before grinding 2. preheated portafilter 3. 3d print a WTD with the help of a friend and his printer 4. work on consistent tampering.  Ill also speak to the roaster I get my beans from as he uses the same machine to test his roasts with a more normal setup than his expensive one. He gave me the parameters 185g coffee producing 37g espresso in 27 seconds which I dont quite get to. Maybe he has an advice as well!,i4c0ojc,/r/espresso/comments/u1e7y7/i_dont_understand_the_consistency_of_my_shots/i4c22yy/'
i4bydud,2022-04-11 12:36:12,ManicSatanic666,u1e7y7,I dont understand the consistency of my shots help please!,Ah I see misunderstood that. My English is a bit improvable üòÖ  When I adjust the grind size I always pull two doses I dont use or I completely empty the grinder depends on how much beans are left.  The shots back to back inconsistency is a bit annoying as trying to find proper settings needs a few tries and waiting in between is not ideal. I will definitely try to heat up the portafilter never did this.,i4bxo9p,/r/espresso/comments/u1e7y7/i_dont_understand_the_consistency_of_my_shots/i4bydud/'
i4bzsdo,2022-04-11 12:45:24,Giroux-TangClan,u1e7y7,I dont understand the consistency of my shots help please!,Are you weighing the beans pouring one dose in the hopper then running the grinder until it‚Äôs empty and weighing the portafilter? The knob that selects the dose size is wildly inaccurate.   I usually put in 17g and make sure I have at least 16.9 in grounds in the basket. Then I stop the machine at 40g out with specialty coffee or medium roasts.,i4bydud,/r/espresso/comments/u1e7y7/i_dont_understand_the_consistency_of_my_shots/i4bzsdo/'
i4c1byi,2022-04-11 12:56:38,ManicSatanic666,u1e7y7,I dont understand the consistency of my shots help please!,I will do this in the future. I started with weighing the beans during my first tries but with an inaccurate kitchen scale. Today I bought a coffee scale and weighed the grounded coffee but it was inconsistent so Ill go back weighing the beans and let them completely run through its easier.  The roaster I got the specialty coffee from owns the exact same machine to test his coffee with a normal setup (good espresso from his 20k setup doesnt mean good coffee for the average customer) and he gave me the parameters 185g coffee producing a 37g shot in 27 seconds. So thats where I was originally aiming at. I will talk to him tomorrow and will also change my routine based on your feedback üòÑ,i4bzsdo,/r/espresso/comments/u1e7y7/i_dont_understand_the_consistency_of_my_shots/i4c1byi/'

i4c0t8n,2022-04-11 12:52:57,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u1dz3g,Good things come to those who wait.,The instruction manual gives you the procedure for both cleaning and descaling and its a good idea to do both. Older BEs dont have a separate descale program and the instructions recommend using vinegar. Use a product like Dezcal (citric acid) instead - it will be much easier to rinse out the acidic taste than it would be with vinegar.  If the machine doesnt come with cleaning tablets use Cafiza or a similar product.  For a scale just get a cheap small one from Amazon. Make sure it has 0.1g resolution.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u1dz3g/good_things_come_to_those_who_wait/i4c0t8n/'

Even if they grind the perfect shot for their equipment you have no guarantee that you will get the same results.  This is all a fancy way of saying grind finer on your own grinder.

The idea is that you dial in EVERY time there is any change in the coffee.  Even though its the same beans it might be that some minor adjustment is needed never assume a grind setting is locked in forever.    You also delegate this important task to the roaster and frankly you have no idea what they actually do.

It also changes based on my dose (although the per gram response is less wild than the per grind step response).   The immediate answer to your question is start upping your dose in 0.3 g increments if your goal is to end up at 9 bar. (Tbh I dont think 8=9-1 bar at pump is bad at all and its certainly better than 10=9+1 bar that an unmodded BDB likes to go up to but to each their own.) You can also ask the roaster to grind a touch finer next time.  The long term answer is what others have already mentioned: you should plan to get a grinder to really start dialing things in. Your machine is capable enough that it can really shine when paired with an equally good grinder.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u1bcsl/shots_are_very_fast_and_running_8_bar_pumps/i4ckzed/'

This section of my kitchen is not a full depth countertop (I believe its 20 instead of 24) so then the portafilter handle ends up getting in the way a lot while youre trying to do anything else.

I‚Äôve been through a crappy Cuisinart (which was awful but certainly started my addiction to espresso) and then a Rancillio Silvia then and Expobar before finally getting to the Decent.

I was getting great shots on my Expobar machine and certainly wasn‚Äôt dissatisfied with it in any way I just felt like I was ready for that next level of control that the Decent gives and now several months in I can definitely say that it was the right move for me.

i4b34y1,2022-04-11 08:55:00,jbetts1790,u190uu,Happy new Niche owner,No never tried adjusting the valve even when I rebuilt the machine a couple years ago. One of the reasons Id like to eventually replace this machine is that I find it difficult to consistently get good shots from day to day.,i4b1h4o,/r/espresso/comments/u190uu/happy_new_niche_owner/i4b34y1/'

i4bif68,2022-04-11 10:31:52,menofgrosserblood,u190uu,Happy new Niche owner,Realistically a DB would save you 3 mins? If you steam your milk then turn off steamer and turn on the water switch for a few seconds temp will drop. I then wait 10 seconds and pull a shot.

i4cdqdg,2022-04-11 14:15:42,menofgrosserblood,u190uu,Happy new Niche owner,I did a month without it the PID then installed. Took me awhile to figure out which I wanted. Installation was relatively easy though I rushed a part and had to go to the hardware store. Works flawlessly. I‚Äôm sure the boiler gets to steam temp faster with the PID but I don‚Äôt have the data to suggest.   And frankly I do pull shots then steam milk as you do but that‚Äôs mostly because I am not focused on speed for milk then espresso.,i4bjbbx,/r/espresso/comments/u190uu/happy_new_niche_owner/i4cdqdg/'

i4bm68r,2022-04-11 10:55:15,staemdeck,u190uu,Happy new Niche owner,Its because I would have to pay 20% off the official price + shipping. Instead of 420 GBP I would pay 500 same as UK people plus shipping 550 total then additional 20% tax when I should only pay one 20% tax not two.

i4ar573,2022-04-11 07:33:01,RockOperaPenguin,u16a5f,Gaggia Classic Pro spraying espresso all over my kitchen,Ive got the same machine OP and have had some issues with spraying.  Gonna say there might be two issues here:  1. I do think its the puck prep specifically over-tampering.  Ive had the same issue generally applying less tamping pressure solved it.  How much pressure to use?  If you have a standard tamper and are filling the basket to its specified weight the top of the tamper should sit about even with the top of the basket.   2. Pre-infusion might also help.  Hit brew give the steam valve an 1/8 twist wait 5 seconds close the steam valve brew as normal.

If theres a tube running down the left side to the drip tray its hooked into a three way valve to prevent what youre describing. That valve would probably be the issue.

After you get your grinds into your basket use a toothpick or something similar to stir the grinds and break up clumps. Once thats done level your grind by tapping on your counter and do a medium tamp then try pulling again. If youre still getting lots of spurts my guess is you need to grind finer or your coffee is too fresh and gassy.

Pretty much everything can be done with an adjustable wrench a flathead screwdriver a phillips head screw driver and maybe an allen wrench.  If you go that route my only suggestion would be to aim for a 1980ish or newer so that you dont have to deal with the screw in heating element. Other than that a La Pavoni that needs work can be made good as new with like $40 in gaskets and some descaler.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u168ys/something_like_the_la_pavoni_europiccola_but_for/i4aephy/'

That one would need all new gaskets a new pressure gauge and to have the sight glass replaced. All pretty easy and quick to do and about $60ish USD in parts. The rust is super common on these machines and dealing with it can be as simple or as complicated as you make it.  The only thing that stands out as a possible red flag is that they say the plug was changed to convert it from 220v to 110v. Im pretty sure the heating element also needs to accommodate 220v or 110v. Im not sure if they did that too or if they truly did just change the plug and ran with it.

I think the Robot has trade offs some better ease of use for having to deal with a deep basket and puck screen/paper filter and better heat management (not insurmountable). On the flip side with the ROK you can use potentially more tools and have more scale options. I also felt like the long term was better with the Robot. Theres essentially one part on the Robot that will wear out every 1-2 years (piston seal) everything else is unlikely to fail from what I can see. That said Ive not seen any real negatives on ROK longevity.   I dont think you need to be ashamed its a nice looking machine. :D,i4a87yp,/r/espresso/comments/u13xji/yall_posting_endgame_pics_and_im_over_here_like/i4aa6gy/'

A couple of years ago I upgraded grinder to the Comandante C-40 with red Clix axle (twice as many steps per click I believe 12micron between clicks).   That proved to me the grinder is really as important as people say.   I went the manual grinder route as I thought I would be getting more ‚Äúwhere it counts‚Äù by not needing to pay for the motor and wiring etc.  I‚Äôm happy with it but it does take about 1:15 to 1:30 (minutes:seconds) to grind a 17g dose.  I also just upgraded to a aftermarket piston and brew chamber from Somedaysomehow_project on Instagram.

i4a0xct,2022-04-11 03:50:11,tessartyp,u13x7k,La Pavoni Pro vs Lelit Bianca for a beginner,Im a lever fiend and would recommend it to anyone beginner or expert but not to you for one reason: the LP is not the machine to pull 3-5 consecutive shots with.  The Pro has a big enough boiler but temp stability isnt amazing. I can do two shots consecutive in the morning for the missus & I but three is pushing it. Typically it needs a few minutes to cool after two shots.  Otherwise its built to last a lifetime it can rival any machine for pure espresso output and with bit of learning (and single-tip wand mod) will also steam amazing microfoam. Its pretty easy to learn to make good shots on it and in some ways its more forgiving than a pump machine. So it answers all your requirements except the 3-5 shots when hosting.  If you have any more questions feel free to hit me up.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u13x7k/la_pavoni_pro_vs_lelit_bianca_for_a_beginner/i4a0xct/'

i4a3rq4,2022-04-11 04:21:53,chesapeek,u13x7k,La Pavoni Pro vs Lelit Bianca for a beginner,Thanks a lot for the response really helpful. That particular requirement is probably the one I was hesitating the most on as well.   I saw there are some techniques for cooling the LPs (from putting the portafilter into cool water between shots which then cools the group head slightly to the bong islolator mod) but I dont know how useful/practical these are in real time.   I see in your flair youve got one so Ill ask one more question if I can - do you think the microfoam quality would be the same on these two machines? It seems like they would both be very good but with my limited noob knowledge it seems like the Bianca would produce better foam with its dedicated steam boiler. However I did see you can mod this on the LP too which apparently helps to change the steam wand to one with 1 hole instead of 3.,i4a0xct,/r/espresso/comments/u13x7k/la_pavoni_pro_vs_lelit_bianca_for_a_beginner/i4a3rq4/'
i4a627o,2022-04-11 04:45:18,tessartyp,u13x7k,La Pavoni Pro vs Lelit Bianca for a beginner,I havent tried mods or special techniques for cooling I like the clean aesthetic of the machine as it is. Spraying the grouphead with water will quickly cool if I need it so Im assuming freezing the portafilter between shots would too. I sometimes do three shots in ~15min and thats fine but more in that time frame is pushing it without mods. It can be done its just not the perfect machine for it.  Being single-boiler at 117c it wont steam as easily as a dedicated boiler (I also have a Silvia Im restoring for reference and that thing rips when in steaming mode) but unless youre doing two full lattes with one pitcher the Pro has enough steam power. In terms of output in the cup its perfect - the limit is my pouring skills. The single-hole mod is one I consider a must it makes a huge difference but Ive seen videos of better baristas than me working with the stock triple-hole too.,i4a3rq4,/r/espresso/comments/u13x7k/la_pavoni_pro_vs_lelit_bianca_for_a_beginner/i4a627o/'

Im still hesitating to be honest. Maybe one day Ill end up with both machines (and also divorced).   Yeah Ive fooled myself with the convenience of the nespresso for long enough.

The Silvia and Lelit are built to commercial spec. I‚Äôve had breville appliances like the smart grinder that started to show issues after 5 years. I‚Äôve had friends with breville machines that needed repair after 4 years. By contrast my rancilio Silvia has been going for 12 years (first in my possession now in my dad‚Äôs) without a hiccup or any visible wear.  For my money if I spend $2000 on an appliance I want it to last decades.

Sometimes it feels like it but it shouldnt be. They have a defined budget which is very reasonable for their needs and desires. Theres no reason to try and upsell them into spending more and its honestly questionable what they would get out of that upgrade. $300 isnt nothing and presenting ever more spending past the point of diminishing returns as the best option to someone asking for advice is IMO rude and irresponsible. I think respecting peoples budgets when they ask for advice is important you dont know their financial situation and unless they specify a flexible budget (which this OP in fact specifies a *firm* budget) then all you are doing is making them feel bad or spend more than theyre comfortable with neither of which is a good thing.,i4bn1e3,/r/espresso/comments/u0vedk/espresso_machine_budget_2000/i4c1vsd/'

Im not criticizing you as a person I am saying (as I have to others who do this all too commonly in this sub) that if your machine explicitly does not meet the requirements set by the OP you should respect that rather than try to convince them of something they have told you they dont want.,i4e34ro,/r/espresso/comments/u0vedk/espresso_machine_budget_2000/i4fanmo/'

This took over the beer world in many ways. Because it was a repeatable transportable scaleable beer system. It truly crushed the real ale movements that were traditionally in place.  And whilst they are lagers it is probably more accurate to call them a styles. Lighter drier beers the Carlsbergs and Henikens are usually fermented with a variation of a Swiss lager yeast.  The Americans also came to the party and added maize to their beers creating a clearer and cheaper beer again they Japanese added rice. Again using lager yeasts. Millers Coors Asahi etc etc  So this gives a clearer beer with adjuncts so you can save a few bucks.  So these lagers were able to be transported all over the world because they packaged well. They installed into most pubs and bars well providing the beer monolithic structure was in place for beer delivery and thus the beers were also repeatable.  Your beer was pretty much the same anywhere in the world.  So youre asking whats the McDonalds of the coffee world gotta be Starbucks. Or maybe its the freeze dried instant coffee?  Bonus points: lager in relation to beer can be beer storage from German lagaren. A yeast strain Saflager 34/70 and by proxy fermentation style. Or a beer styler Japanese rice lager.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0uwzj/craft_beer_drinkers_of_respresso_what_is_the/i48r78z/'

i48b03m,2022-04-10 17:05:27,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u0u0od,Recommendation as a beginner,The brewer on the Barista Express is similar (but not quite identical) to the Bambino. Similarly the grinder on the Barista Express is similar to the Smart Grinder Pro. So if you buy a Bambino and use it with your Smart Grinder Pro you have a setup with similar capabilities to what you would have gotten with a Barista Express. There would be no additional benefit to getting a Barista Express.  The advantage of the Bambino is that you can upgrade your grinder and have a much much better setup than the Barista Express.,i4886lw,/r/espresso/comments/u0u0od/recommendation_as_a_beginner/i48b03m/'

A car exhaust shop is cheapest. Have the last 2.5cm cut at 45deg angle on one end.    * This is worth doing even if you stick to a hopper. * There is a wire to jump google how. * New genuine burrs are money well spent on a used grinder. SSP is even better.  If you dont have someone to print I can do so suspect postage would be \~$AU30 (cost) to UK/US based on a quote I got for 500g to UK.

i484pbn,2022-04-10 16:16:52,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u0t3i9,Grinder for Espresso and filter coffee,The [Lucca Atom 75](https://clivecoffee.com/products/lucca-atom-75-espresso-grinder) comes close to what you want with a digital display or phone app that controls grind settings.  If you need a lower price point the Niche Zero is your best bet. Although it is stepless it has a huge grind dial (its the diameter of the grinders body) and its easy to set it coarser for filter and then get it back to the exact previous espresso setting without needing to dial in again.  DF64 may also be a good choice for you.  Many people who are serious about both brew methods just get two grinders.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0t3i9/grinder_for_espresso_and_filter_coffee/i484pbn/'
i48dpkv,2022-04-10 17:26:38,slickmamba,u0t3i9,Grinder for Espresso and filter coffee,Good grinders have consistent grind settings that let you easily swap between filter and espresso.  You would want to purge some beans to have the best coffee between methods anyway.    Depending on the type of espresso/filter you like you likely will not have a grinder that is good for both since the burr design for traditional high body espresso does terribly for quality high clarity filtered coffee and vice versa,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0t3i9/grinder_for_espresso_and_filter_coffee/i48dpkv/'

Apart from price I dont think it has any downsides after several months of using it myself. Its super easy to use and you can grind for any brew method from turkish through to french. Going back and forth between grind settings is reliable too. It is a single dose grinder so gotta keep that in mind. Close to zero retention. Its a flat burr grinder with 83mm burrs. It does make funny noises at times due to coffee getting stuck in different places.

I had the Specialita the XL and the Turbo in comparsion. And the Turbo is my go to.  Many will tell there is No difference between 55mm and 65mm burrs. But there is the espresso has a much clearer Taste and the dial in ist much easier. Even shots that are mit perfect timed (27s) will taste with less flow (23s) still good.

If you are going to leave beans in the hopper and dose by time then its well worth the extra money.   The Perfetto is supposed to be an all purpose grinder but it has a very finicky grind dial adjustment. On the other Mignons the espresso range might be 1/2 a turn of the grind dial. On the Perfetto it might be 1/8 of turn. So dialing in the Perfetto will be a lot harder.  If you are going to single dose then the timer on the Specialita is a waste of money and you should get the Silenzio.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0rxfg/which_eureka_mignon_for_espresso/i485vy9/'

i47ud08,2022-04-10 14:59:55,slickmamba,u0rw8q,Flair 58: Im getting a lot of channeling,That‚Äôs not channeling. It‚Äôs typical for shots to look like this when you grind very fine for lighter roasts.   The ‚Äúbald‚Äù looking spots aren‚Äôt really an issue. Coffee seems to be coming out from all the holes just extraction from adjacent holes are going in opposite directions. It looks fairly evenly extracted.   Copied and pasted from an older post:  its really a non issue and is very common with lighter roasts and precision baskets where you have to grind finer and the beans are more dense.  It can also develop as the shot goes on like you see and is completely normal.  You can see coffee is coming out of all the holes the adjacent holes just have streams coming out in different directions which gives the illusion of a bald spot but its still extracting fine.  Its not a puck prep issue.  Here are some pics of where a ‚Äúbald spot‚Äù is from bad distribution.  Notice how there are actual spots where coffee is not coming out of and where there is coffee it is very uneven in extraction level(lots of darker and lighter coffee)  https://miro.medium.com/max/1142/1*VhkezcQmGYFJRc222UOPpQ.png  https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/espresso-lead-image.jpg?q=h_900w_1600x_0y_0   edit: for the nerds out there trying to get the most out of your shot and ensure even extraction on light roasts /u/jkim_makes made a great video about it that addresses the dark ring and any dark unextracted spots you might have  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPEE9Lsb1oE,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0rw8q/flair_58_im_getting_a_lot_of_channeling/i47ud08/'

i48v5hw,2022-04-10 19:44:24,redsunstar,u0rw8q,Flair 58: Im getting a lot of channeling,A few comments.  1. The dry spots arent really dry spots with a light roast and MP burrs in a Lagom thats normal.   2. With that said your WDT could still be improved the fill-in that is the second when coffee starts beading is quite uneven. Ideally all the spots holes should bead at the same time. https://i.imgur.com/wh9ck2U.png  3. The advice of a 25-30s shot is given for a non-preinfused shot with the duration starting from pump activation. That includes the time it takes for the water to arrive at and fill the volume above the puck. So on a Flair when you start with the volume above already filled thats a 20-25s press.   4. With that said taste is king. If this works for you and the coffees you like this works for you. Personally I grind much coarser and pull at 16:48 under 20s from the moment I start pressing. Under 1 bar until the bottom is beading then a fast ramp to 6 and a slow decrease to 4. Look up the video about turbo shots by Lance Hedrick. With light roasts and a fast burr like the 64 MP thats ideal.   5. Bottom paper filters allow you to extract high and fast. https://coffeeadastra.com/2021/04/04/how-a-paper-filter-below-an-espresso-puck-affects-hydraulic-resistance/,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0rw8q/flair_58_im_getting_a_lot_of_channeling/i48v5hw/'

Try grinding more coarse and/or dosing a little less to see if you can get coffee out.   Is the machine new? Screws should not be stripped if it is new.

In fact they aren‚Äôt calibrated at all so when they come to you no coffee has ever been run through them. This is why some people get the same result grinding with a 15 as others get grinding with a 5. In the extreme case the burrs sit so far from one another that even at 1A you are not able to grind finely enough and in these situations you need to add a shim to push the burrs a bit closer together.

i498slh,2022-04-10 21:50:34,hedonist222,u0qboi,baratza 270 owners - why shim?,But calibration has nothing to do with it. The bottom burr screws onto the machine just like every other baratza burr.

i49zv5u,2022-04-11 03:37:27,antheus1,u0qboi,baratza 270 owners - why shim?,This is a machine made of a mix of plastic and metal making incredibly minute adjustments. These parts are not 100% identical. Perhaps theyre 97.5% the same or 99% the same who knows. The thing is that **the adjustments they are making are so small that even a fraction of a percent of a difference in the burr size/burr proximity could result in a variation in the grind.** Now when you add together multiple parts that have a 1% variation your variation between machines magnifies. Then you factor in age ambient temperature and any other variables that can affect how close the burrs are to one another and the result is that not everyone has the same settings.  If you believe that these machines are so exact that there is no variation from one to another then why dont you prove it to yourself? Dial a shot take your machine apart put it back together and then try the exact same setting. Do you expect it to be the exact same output? An even simpler way to prove this would be for you to move your dial all the way to the coarsest setting and push some beans through the grinder then to move back to the same setting youre grinding for espresso and see if you get the exact same output. If simply taking your own machine apart and putting it back together creates a variation in your grind then how can you believe that all of these parts are so precise that they should just be plug and play and give the same result?  The only way to eliminate or minimize these variations out of the box would be to use more expensive parts and more expensive manufacturing processes which would result in a more expensive grinder. Consider the opposite case of needing a shim. Lets say that the burrs are slightly longer to the point that even on the coarsest setting they grind too fine. The only way to fix this problem is by getting new burrs. So in light of this I suspect it is a design choice by baratza to not try to create burrs that sit exact because within 1-2 standard deviations of burr size you wind up creating burrs that sit too close and when this happens you have to toss them out. Instead they probably undershoot by design so that when the burrs are 1-2 standard deviations too long they can still be used and when they are 1-2 standard deviations too short it only takes the simple placement of a shim or two to make things perfect.,i498slh,/r/espresso/comments/u0qboi/baratza_270_owners_why_shim/i49zv5u/'

When doing this you can watch the brewhead pressure drop (even though the boiler pressure stays at 9bars) because the total 9bars of pressure must be shared between the points of restriction (the puck and the needle value).  Thus it is still possible that you have a restriction in your feed tube from the boiler to the brewhead - \*if\* youre viewing the brewhead pressure (and not the boiler).,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0orc3/profitec_pro_700_issues_after_descaling_no/i4a5h55/'

The Elizabeth also has preinfusion and some nice features.  The other contender that does this very well is the Sage/Breville dual boiler. It has the steam capacity and thermal stability to do 5 back to back cappuccinos same as the Elizabeth and the Profitec.,i47uw0s,/r/espresso/comments/u0ol4a/recommend_me_an_espresso_machine_available_in/i49bznj/'

No issues.  The most drinks Ive ever made for guests were 4. And I pulled all 4 shots before steaming.  Dont worry about boiler size the boiler is always topped up when you pull shots since water is drawn from tank and pushed through the boiler before the portafilter.,i4aoqbc,/r/espresso/comments/u0ol4a/recommend_me_an_espresso_machine_available_in/i4bq08v/'
i4frg35,2022-04-12 08:15:28,AmNotLost,u0ol4a,Recommend me an espresso machine available in Europe that can make 2 cappuccinos in a row,(1) Id get the non-plus Bambino before the Plus -- its $200 less and personally I dont think the extra features are worth $200 for a machine of that quality/repairability. It is easier to switch from shots to steam using the Bambino vs. the Anna since the Anna is a single boiler.  (2) Im telling you what Id do if it was money. Knowing my experience Id spend the extra to get an excellent entry level DB. However if you cant afford both the Elizabeth and a good grinder then the non-plus Bambino and a good espresso grinder (like the Mignon Specialita or Notte or Niche Zero) is how Id go. Personally.  Edit: the phoenix is a very sufficient grinder. I may still keep the phoenix and get the DB.,i47pvr9,/r/espresso/comments/u0ol4a/recommend_me_an_espresso_machine_available_in/i4frg35/'

i4w9p76,2022-04-15 16:50:44,elegoomba,u0ol4a,Recommend me an espresso machine available in Europe that can make 2 cappuccinos in a row,Oops just saw this. Pull all your shots first. Then froth in a larger pitcher and then transfer half into a normal size pitcher and pour your first drink then repeat for the second. Can be replicated for X number of drinks. Plenty of videos on YT demonstrating it. The transferring is necessary to regulate foam if you just pour from one pitcher back to back then each drink will have less foam than the previous.,i4aou12,/r/espresso/comments/u0ol4a/recommend_me_an_espresso_machine_available_in/i4w9p76/'

Since I‚Äôll be pulling max two shots 99% of the time  a single boiler machine seems more than enough. And I‚Äôll also be able to afford a good grinder! Got any recommendations?     I was under the impression that the ‚Äúnew water in the boiler might need some time to warm up and that I‚Äôd have to wait another 10-20 minutes for it to warm up (just like when you start the machine in the morning) before pulling another shot (?).  &#x200B  I have also been considering Lelit Victoria and Ascaso Steel Uno PID since they have 58 mm portafilters (unlike Anna).,i4bq08v,/r/espresso/comments/u0ol4a/recommend_me_an_espresso_machine_available_in/i4cc3uj/'
i4khlfz,2022-04-13 07:24:52,FlatWhiteAndBougie,u0ol4a,Recommend me an espresso machine available in Europe that can make 2 cappuccinos in a row,>	(1) I‚Äôd get the non-plus Bambino before the Plus  In the end I end with the Bambino Plus. The non-plus is not so much cheaper than the Plus in Europe AFAIAA. However the main reason why I went with the Plus over the non-plus is the automatic frothing as my SO will use the machine as well and shed prefer a machine that froths milk by itself.   >	It is easier to switch from shots to steam using the Bambino vs. the Anna since the Anna is a single boiler.  The Bambino is also a single boiler right? The difference is that it has ThermoJet technology.   >	Knowing my experience I‚Äôd spend the extra to get an excellent entry level DB.  Right now I think getting a DB would be an overkill for me. Id rather make all the mistakes I am going to make on a cheaper machine and then get a more expensive one once Im more experienced. Why would you go straight to a DB?   I did get the Mignon Specialita though!  >	the phoenix is a very sufficient grinder. I may still keep the phoenix and get the DB.

Id recommend the mignon series for the grinder. If you go for a filtro/chrono and it comes with the new brew burrs you can do an espresso burr swap for about 40 bucks.

i47xkn8,2022-04-10 15:23:17,EmdhRVA,u0o2dq,What the heck happened...?,I had the same thing happen to my Silenzio back in the winter. It had run perfectly since I got it last spring with zero problems and then it started clogging up. I did a deep clean and cleared it all out and then it happened again a few weeks later. Come to find out it was the dryness in the air due to the change of seasons here on the east coast. I started spritzing a short fine mist of water onto the top of the beans in the mini hopper (I also single dose) and along with using the bellows it hasnt happened once since then. And Im actually noticing now I dont need to pump the bellows as much because its getting warmer and not so dry. Obviously any small mister will work but this is the one I got on amazon it works great and goes with an espresso aesthetic.

Grinder is less only three and a half months old (purchased late Jan 2022) and it is single-dosified with a short hopper bellows and angled stand. It was completely unclogged when I left. It was also recently brushed out (though not fully disassembled). 18g in 17.8g out (ish usually occasionally I get .1 or so grams more than I put it which of course is when some gets around the declumpifier fingers in the machine).

i4757gk,2022-04-10 12:03:04,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u0nbgy,Gaggia Classic Pro lost its crema,Problems like the one you are describing are almost never caused by the espresso machine and are almost always caused by the beans and occasionally by the grinder. You say you havent changed beans but a new bag of the same brand and type of bean can be very different due to roasting variations. Also as a bag of beans ages shots will run faster which can result in more watered-down shots and you need to compensate for that by grinding finer.  The best way for you to get more help is to post a video of a shot pulling and to answer our normal shot diagnosis questions:  * Grinder: * Roast date: (not a Best by date). If the roast date is not labeled use N/A * Dose: How many grams are going into your basket? * Yield: How much coffee in grams is coming out? * Time: How long is the shot running? * Roast level: How dark is your coffee?

If you had in mind to singledose have you thought on the eureka crono w/ espresso burrs? Maybe it would be a way to save if timed dosing on the specialita wasnt the reason to choose it.   Since you have a bias towards the Silvia it is a nice machine which will be upgradable/modable along the way more so than the others (58mm group model has been on the market for years big community).

i46t39o,2022-04-10 10:40:37,genosse_klappstuhl,u0lx2h,Option O - Logome Mini - April Drop issues,I can grind 19g of medium roasts in one batch 4.5-5 from touching point.   If the roasts get lighter sometimes there is a small stall time of 10 sec where it stutters.   It does not sound normal what you are experiencing.

Dark roasts are much less dense due to having a lot more moisture pulled out of the bean during roasting.  You will tend to find that you will need to drop the dose for example from 18grams to 16 or 17 grams and also grind a little coarser for a similar extraction.   Dark roasts are usually easier to dial in as the coffee machine doesnt have to work as hard to push the water through to extract before brewing you would just need to adjust your brew temp lower as higher temps extract more bitter/burnt flavours,i475t7y,/r/espresso/comments/u0lc0o/new_addition_to_my_coffee_bar_hopefully_proves_to/i478b2d/'

Not necessarily for the actual taste.   But no matter the tools in the end it comes down to the beans and the settings you brew them at. Wrong bean at the wrong temp and you will get bad stuff out of the most fancy setup.  And personal taste plays into it as well.

Ive learned that to get more of the latter at the former to watch and see if the baristas are good first and second if they are not slammed to tell them that youre in no hurry and can wait if they need to dial in or recalibrate for the different time of day etc. This has about a 60% success rate for me. 30% of the time if they are not busy they will say - oh yeah its dialed in or ok thanks and then do nothing. 60% of the time baristas work in 3rd wave shops because they love coffee and will actually be appreciative and take a few shots to recalibrate (nows the time to hit them up with questions about the coffee what they are looking for out of the beans etc). These shots are often times amazing and surprising in whatever characteristics of the coffee the barista is trying to highlight. Then the other 10% of the time Ive got my head up my own ass and mistook the shop or baristas available time/desire/skill to adjust the shot and I get what I get lol,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0knnp/decided_to_humble_myself_by_going_to_a_cafe/i474594/'
i489hc0,2022-04-10 16:53:33,rugbysecondrow,u0knnp,Decided to humble myself by going to a cafe,I own a few shops and almost nobody orders straight espresso.  We treat our espresso more as an ingredient than as a stand alone product.  It still tastes delicious alone but it is optimized for milk and mixing.  There are better beans fro espresso for sure but many of those beans dont taste as good as an ingredient.  The business reality espresso shots retails for about $2 add steam milk and that is a $5 drink.  Add flavoring and it is a $6 drinks.  You see where I am going and why optimizing for higher paying customers makes the most sense.  Last opinion too many gadgets = not enough skill.  A high quality grinder and machine helps but all this pick prep nonsense is unimportant.  If you have proper burrs and a dialed in machine you barely have to tamp to get a delicious espresso.

Unless the cafe is terrible there is no way someone that‚Äôs been making espresso for a month would be able to taste nuance.   The issue is probably the lighter roast that the shop is using.

What makes it funny is the really good shops don‚Äôt WDT or use a distribution tool either and realistically why would they need to with an ek43 and great coffee dialed in. Meanwhile the last time I went to one of these trendy places by me the barista used a dosing funnel stirred the grounds used a distribution tool and some kind of force tamper only to pull me a sub 20 second shot without weighing the output.

i48ibrp,2022-04-10 18:02:58,ctl7g,u0knnp,Decided to humble myself by going to a cafe,Lol. Some people love foam no matter where it comes from.   In all honesty I get that. Thats why I think the mindset of how cafes and home baristas approach espresso is an important distinction. There can be a lot of entitlement that customers who have never worked in food service bring from home. As for asking to dial in its more offering the space to do so if desired its all in the approach. Im never going to say anything if theres a line of people in front or behind me. I dont expect nor do I begrudge the baristas for telling me its already dialed it and it is or if they dont have time to do it. At the same time Im probably not going to order a shot if it looks like they look like they arent coming out with any real thought or intention. Finally the amount of times my offer is taken with enthusiasm is probably enough for me to continue to offer it.

I went to a cafe one time and had the best espresso shot of my life. Went the next morning and had the worst espresso shot of my life. There are so many factors that can throw off espresso that your bad shot could have been a one off. I generally give most cafes three bad shots before I write them off. That said they might be bad at espresso but make a great filter coffee. Ive had multiple coffee shop owners tell me that the good stuff is their filter coffee and the only reason they even have an espresso machine is that customers expect it,i46hpel,/r/espresso/comments/u0knnp/decided_to_humble_myself_by_going_to_a_cafe/i487lmd/'

i4a8t14,2022-04-11 05:11:25,barker88,u0knnp,Decided to humble myself by going to a cafe,Not true. I looked long and hard at the gaggia and while it is a great machine its double the price. $299 for the Bambino $599 for the Gaggia. On top of that I would want the PID mod kit and the OPV mod kit on the Gaggia which is another $230 and thats before installation if youre not installing it yourself. Ive looked into the process of installing the Gaggia PID. Its not a cake walk. The Bambino has a built-in PID. So now youre looking at $830 for the Gaggia versus $299 for the Bambino.  Ive heard that Breville machines can be hit or miss with quality control. That said I have a good friend whos owned a Breville duo temp pro for 9 years used daily and its still going strong. Theyve also never descaled their machine. Regardless I bought an extra 3 years warranty on my Bambino for $60 just in case.  So when all is said and done $359 for the Bambino versus $830 for a Gaggia that I still need to open up and modify. Not the same price at all.,i49uf4p,/r/espresso/comments/u0knnp/decided_to_humble_myself_by_going_to_a_cafe/i4a8t14/'

i4ddxwm,2022-04-11 18:33:22,esperalegant,u0knnp,Decided to humble myself by going to a cafe,Thats a weird take. Heres a different way of looking at it: a baristas job is to make customers enjoy their experience and want to come back to the cafe.   Part of what makes customers come back is their overall experience of the cafe the decor the noise levels and their interaction with the staff. Another part is the coffee itself. If the staff are unfriendly but everything else is good they still probably wont come back. So the baristas job - well they dont have to be some crazy bubbly energizer bunny. But they need to be professional in dealing with customers. And part of being professional is basic friendliness.,i4b3bqb,/r/espresso/comments/u0knnp/decided_to_humble_myself_by_going_to_a_cafe/i4ddxwm/'

But this probably means that when things are off no one is going to fix it until the one guy shows up.,i4a93hx,/r/espresso/comments/u0knnp/decided_to_humble_myself_by_going_to_a_cafe/i4a9f20/'

Most importantly:     >These people have always had to fake enthusiasm for the benefit of the business that employs them and their low compensation has never accounted for that emotional burden  If employees are compensated properly and well taken care of there usually arent issues with staff being unfriendly. If there are the impetus is on the cafe owner to fix that. Compare your average experiences with sales associates at Walmart (underpaid undervalued) versus Costco (usually well compensated at all levels with both salary and benefits).  Baristas are paid to make and serve coffee. It is on the business owner to make sure customers enjoy their experience and want to come back to the cafe. The barista gets the same mediocre pay either way.

But saying that a reputable shop serves horrific espresso and comparing it to preground coffee that you pulled on your first shot EVER is absolutely hyperbole.   Cafes are not home espresso labs where you can sit around and dial in your grinder for 2 hours while in search of the perfect 28-32 second shot. When you are in the weeds and have customers stacked outside the door that kinda goes out the window sometimes. Judging a shop by an espresso you ordered one time is absolutely not a fair way to judge a shop.   It‚Äôs like looking at a chef and saying ‚ÄúI make steak very well at home this steak isn‚Äôt as good as the one I make at home‚Äù like okay good for you go back home then don‚Äôt let the door hit you on the way out.,i46prm8,/r/espresso/comments/u0knnp/decided_to_humble_myself_by_going_to_a_cafe/i476x5q/'
i47fq39,2022-04-10 13:16:13,Okaberino,u0knnp,Decided to humble myself by going to a cafe,What ?  When going to a restaurant you pay to eat and usually at a premium so youre expecting to eat better than at home. What youre saying makes no sense.  Thats why things should be as perfect as possible all the time because people WILL judge what theyre being served AND your establishment to potentially NEVER come back. Was it a one time mistake ? Is it fair ? Maybe not but thats how it is.  Though your customer might be a unicorn that takes pretty damn good coffee at home and can judge your beverage in ways most customers cannot...  You also keep bringing this reputable shop thing from OP but to be fair what does this even mean ? Lots of people think Starbucks is the greatest thing on earth while some real coffee aficionados would say it is overrated crap. I dont know cant judge Starbucks arent everywhere here in France.  Some cafes lack the time to properly \*personalise\* their preparations. The cons of some working environment... But this depends of the place I would say.  Anyway it all comes back to one thing if people are disappointed especially if your establishment has its name going for it theyre going to judge you hard and probably never come back. Simple as that.  Finally OP expected good coffee from that place. Things seems to have been well executed with top of the line equipment nothing like what they have at home.  Boom the coffee tastes bad. What else is there to say ? Maybe it wasnt to their taste ? Who knows ? OPs the one who had it. Maybe this is one of those popular/trendy places that arent all that good ? Maybe OP have peculiar tastes in coffee or made hasty judgement. Whatever.  Bottom line was that good equipment at a professionals doesnt necessarily equals to good coffee. With craft and perseverance at home a lower budget can sill get you amazing stuff.  &#x200B  Thats all there is to it.,i476x5q,/r/espresso/comments/u0knnp/decided_to_humble_myself_by_going_to_a_cafe/i47fq39/'

How can I fix this?,Increase resistance due to corrosion. Super common in electronics that vibrate. Since the vibration will rub off the plating exposing the copper or aluminum. A super thin dab of dielectric grease is a good solution. And now is a good time to check all other connections for corrosion and nip it in the bud. If you cant find replacement plastic cover for that connector you can use kapton (or off brand) tape. Theyre good for high heat applications.

i46fplr,2022-04-10 09:12:05,beer_foam,u0jhfi,New equipment help,Ill add that Breville calls the pressurized baskets dual wall and un-pressurized single wall. This is what you might need: [https://www.breville.com/ca/en/parts-accessories/parts/sp0001520.html](https://www.breville.com/ca/en/parts-accessories/parts/sp0001520.html) (it looks sold out but you might be able to search the part number on ebay or try a precision basket from IMS [https://www.imsfiltri.com/filters/?comp=breville-sage](https://www.imsfiltri.com/filters/?comp=breville-sage))   If this isnt the issue I have found dialing in is easier if you start with grinds that are obviously much too coarse (looks closer to filter grind) you get a shot that runs too fast grind a little finer next shot should run slower and just walk it in this way.   After a while you will start to learn where to set your grinder to get in the ballpark and how much to adjust based on what your shot is doing.,i469z2x,/r/espresso/comments/u0jhfi/new_equipment_help/i46fplr/'
i46cat6,2022-04-10 08:49:16,p3ach33,u0jhfi,New equipment help,Thanks for your reply. I believe so. The Breville comes with single wall and dual wall baskets and I switched to the single wall. No luck.,i469z2x,/r/espresso/comments/u0jhfi/new_equipment_help/i46cat6/'

You have this backwards light roasts are less brittle. Theyre denser since they retain more oils and have not had their cellulose degraded by heat as much as darker roasts.  This means light roasts dont shatter as easily as darker roasts therefore producing less fines. But it also makes them harder to grind meaning many grinders fail to grind them adequately or consistently resulting in a larger spread of particle sizes. This is why you need to grind finer to extract traditional espresso from light roasts or if youre a modern thinker grind coarser and pull turbos.,i463zrx,/r/espresso/comments/u0j0j8/please_help_me_figure_out_whether_its_too_fresh/i48x78a/'

Each gap on Jmax is 0.0088mm I tried 120 it caused choke and 130 works fine so from the choking to working is 0.088mm,i473mli,/r/espresso/comments/u0j0j8/please_help_me_figure_out_whether_its_too_fresh/i477ypj/'

i465ns0,2022-04-10 08:02:58,pizzarunner,u0irqr,What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs favorite coffee beans?,Darker roasts are generally easier to dial in and more likely to make a sweet tasting shot. Unless the shot you got in Hungary was at a modern 3rd wave shop it was probably a quite dark roast - that‚Äôs traditional in most of Europe.   Light roast espresso is tricky and can be a bit of an acquired taste even when everything goes right - you‚Äôll often hear light roast shots described as ‚Äúbright‚Äù - it‚Äôs going to be acidic just because of the coffee you‚Äôre working with. I‚Äôd ignore the caffeine difference and just drink what you like the taste of dark or light‚Ä¶ caffeine difference is going to be marginal and you can always drink more coffee.  Is there a well regarded local roaster/shop where you can go get an espresso confirm you like it then buy the beans they‚Äôre using? Then you can narrow down the issue to technique or equipment knowing the beans can produce something you like.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0irqr/what_are_yalls_favorite_coffee_beans/i465ns0/'

The exception would be if there‚Äôs an accurate roast date on each dispenser and the beans are less than a week or so out from roast.

Buying a machine even a known brand wont reduce your prep time. You may reduce the time for back-to-back drinks but I dont know if its worth it considering your options. Maybe invest in a better grinder for now and wait until you have to money for a known reliable machine.  Edit: Actually you may have an easier time and get better results with an Aeropress. You can make a good strong cup with it. Plus back-to-back drink time will be greatly reduced when compared to a moka.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0fx3c/how_is_this_combo_gemilai_3605_019_flat_burr/i46qjym/'

I got a new coffee and it took me 3 weeks to finally get a good shot with my moka pot out of it. I also dont have a grinder at all I take the beans to my local cafe weekly and they grind it for me.  but Im waiting to invest in this setup going even higher would be hard to do.

Gemilai 3605 + 019 flat burr grinder ~$260,I really dont like the moka pot or Aeropress but I prefer the Aeropress for an espresso-like coffee because its easier to troubleshoot especially if you have limited grinding options. Just my opinion. You should stick with what you prefer.  If interested Hoffmann has a good Aeropress recipe for this here:  https://youtu.be/ZgIVfU0xBjA  I think the advantage of the Gaggia would be that its strengths and shortcomings are well known and theres a huge user community. Also mods and repairs are easy and parts are available (depending on your location). However wouldnt want to steer you away from the Gamilai if you think its better for your circumstances. I just cant find much information on it which would keep me away from it.,i49q6ri,/r/espresso/comments/u0fx3c/how_is_this_combo_gemilai_3605_019_flat_burr/i4a64j1/'

Sure thats what it says in the manual. Ive had mine a month and it had to do a descale yesterday. Maybe there are two types of clean to do and one is only every year?  Also I took my shower screen off the other day to just check what was under there. I was considering getting an IMS shower screen for better water distribution (ended up getting a puck screen instead). Anyway I noticed that after I put the shower screen back on the water was distributing differently one stream way stronger than the others. To solve that problem I removed the shower screen again and put it back in a different position I then had three or four streams that were coming out fairly evenly. Just thought it was worth mentioning in case you wanted to try that.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0f3js/help_with_my_bambino_plus_after_doing_a_cleaning/i45u2qg/'

i45ah21,2022-04-10 02:56:00,cyclevegan,u0ec4p,My DIY WDT made from acupuncture needles and a ¬£1 whisk,I made this using nine 0.35 acupuncture needles from AliExpress and the handle from a cheap whisk. The original plan was to use the whisk itself as the needles but the prongs were much too thick. As is its a slightly wasteful way to make a WDT but it works and looks quite smart.  The acupuncture needles are held in place by friction. Before squeezing them into the handle I wrapped the ends together in PTFE tape (adding more and more until I got a suitably snug fit). My original plan was to use a hot glue gun but that got messy quickly.  I also bent the needles outwards before putting them into the handle and then fine tuned the spread by choosing how far in to push them. Bending the needles once they were in place didnt work well.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0ec4p/my_diy_wdt_made_from_acupuncture_needles_and_a_1/i45ah21/'

Bellows are those big pumps you used to see next to a huge forge in medieval movies and the blacksmith would pump it a bunch of times to get more air into the fire.   For coffee it‚Äôs a little rubber cap-thing the same diameter as the top of your rocky. You put in your beans grind and as it‚Äôs finishing pump the bellows once or twice. It pushes any retained grinds out so they don‚Äôt stay in the machine. It makes single dosing a lot easier!

I grind about 20g in 20 seconds with my k4 which is comparable to the 1zpressos. I do it while my blank shot runs. To *me* that‚Äôs crazy fast and not at all worth paying $350-$700 to avoid although I am huge on saving money through a little extra work.  I can‚Äôt imagine having yet another appliance that permanently lives on my counter and needs another outlet and paying 3-5x what I did to get the same quality grind with less portability (I got mine on sale for $95 rather than $140). I enjoy the mini workout and not having to worry about a bunch of ground coffee being retained in the burrs and costing me more money to purge. It‚Äôs a satisfying quiet pleasant sound. Once I‚Äôm done I pop the handle off and stick it on a shelf near my machine and it takes up a 2 inch footprint. Very few parts so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it breaking itself or needing expensive repairs if it does.   That being said it is an extra 20-30 seconds of manual effort added to every shot so be sure you‚Äôre going to enjoy that before you go for it!,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0bp65/are_manual_grinders_practical_for_daily_use/i45e8qu/'

That rather depends on your arms and those of the people around you.  Personally I prefer manual grinding. At a half dozen shots a day its not only acceptable its enjoyable.  I love adding more hand back into the espresso process the same way I love pulling shots on a lever. It makes the process of producing espresso more tactile.  Its also far far more quiet.

I hand grinded with my 1zpresso jx pro for over a year for espresso and Ive just upgraded to an electric DF64. Electric is a luxury in comparison. The JX is awesome value for money and creates good coffee. But what really started to wind me up (no pun intended) is Ive got into lighter roasts and my god dialing a new bag is not at all enjoyable dont care what anyone else says they are lying. Arm starts to ache after more than one or two shots personally and Im not exactly unfit have a manual job.   Also having more than one bag on at a time and constantly changing grind size with small tweaks is a bit finicky.  I realised it was actually starting to put me off making coffee as Id think argh god Ive got to grind it first.  Darker roasts it does it pretty easy and filter 1000% recommend its a breeze.

I would say the following after a few weeks of daily use:  1) the quality has been surprisingly good (I‚Äôd almost say amazing maybe I had low expectations from the Timemore C2) 2) it a really pleasurable experience grinding your coffee and really doesn‚Äôt take long at all for sure each shot takes longer but only a minute or two‚Ä¶. but 3) its not hard to do but I do drink a lot of coffee and on my 3rd or 4th shot of the day the novelty does start to wear off and I even had some arm ache the other day  But when I‚Äôm not at home with my commercial grinder my options are limited and it‚Äôs way way preferable to a cheap small electric grinder even one with burrs.  I even plan to use it at home sometimes to compare to my usual method of grinding and see if I can improve the output of either even more but also just because I‚Äôm the kind of coffee geek who like to feel in control and you feel every bean and that‚Äôs a nice feeling and makes me wonder what would happen if I grind at different rates etc.  Anyway 1-2 cups a day yeah easy and highly recommended if I drank only 1-2 cups I‚Äôd probably get rid of my other grinder.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u0bp65/are_manual_grinders_practical_for_daily_use/i4554ex/'

i46byva,2022-04-10 08:47:01,mrcizzo,u0bgog,BBE Low Pressure Diagnosis,More potentially obvious questions so forgive me:  1.	Are you locking your portafilter in all the way where it‚Äôs tight vs positioning it to be perpendicular from your machine? 2.	Did your gasket you replaced come with a beveled side and a flat side?

i46fta1,2022-04-10 09:12:46,edelweiss5260,u0bgog,BBE Low Pressure Diagnosis,No worries on the potentially obvious questions. I appreciate your debugging help. 1.	Yes I‚Äôm locking the portafilter all the way to the right. 2.	I installed the gasket with the flat side up against the group head in the same orientation the original gasket was installed.

i46mdsu,2022-04-10 09:56:16,mrcizzo,u0bgog,BBE Low Pressure Diagnosis,Oops I completely didnt even consider that Breville gaskets might be shaped differently. Thats good to know.  My thought is that it seems like the hissing corresponds to your lack of pressure. The hissing doesnt occur when the portafilter isnt attached so its not a hissing coming from within the machine potentially.  It could be hissing from air escaping between the portafilter and the grouphead. It is still possible that the pressure results in something internal to the machine leaking pressure causing that noise but I imagine those two sounds might be distinct enough to know whether its coming from external to the machine vs internally.  Are you using the pressurized baskets with your portafilter? Does it occur when you use a single-wall basket? Also is there any apparent leaking of water when the hissing occurs?,i46fta1,/r/espresso/comments/u0bgog/bbe_low_pressure_diagnosis/i46mdsu/'
i46u38o,2022-04-10 10:47:15,edelweiss5260,u0bgog,BBE Low Pressure Diagnosis,I agree the hissing seems related. I haven‚Äôt been able to find the source however. Furthermore there are no leaks. When I pull a double shot using the default volume settings I get the expected volume of water through the group head just at a much lower than expected pressure.   I discovered the problem while using a single wall basket. I‚Äôve switched to using a dual wall basket for diagnosis so I wouldn‚Äôt have to waste coffee.  At times while pulling water through the group head without the portafilter I‚Äôve noticed the water coming out slower and a few times with a decent amount of steam. So I wonder if the water may be spending too much time in the group head and getting too hot and starting to boil and the hissing sound I‚Äôm hearing is some of the water turning to steam. That‚Äôs my current hypothesis for why I hear a hiss but don‚Äôt see any evidence of a leak. It has me turning my attention to the 3-way solenoid valve.,i46mdsu,/r/espresso/comments/u0bgog/bbe_low_pressure_diagnosis/i46u38o/'

As for beans - Id advise dark roasts theyre easier to extract and give you GOOD feedback for changes in the brewing process. PLUS you dont have to throw away as much.

Brewing times are a more fluid term some people only start timing from the moment liquid hits the cup.  I personally time from the second I push the button so that includes pre-infusion.

With this method the foam was amazing but to thick and I couldnt really do latte art cause the foam was not being incorporated it was all in a layer on the top.  After this I gave a shot to the nanofoamer I kept reading about. Tl Dr the button is horrible but it takes like 2 minutes to take out the metal press thing and mold it to be easier to press.

In particular I struggle with either (a) too much microfoam (to the point where I cant make latte art) or (b) too many macro-foam bubbles.

i464b1m,2022-04-10 07:53:14,Ser_Klatu,u0997t,French Press vs.Stovetop Steamer (Bellman) for Producing Steamed Milk/Microfoam,I usually make cortados as well and I totally know the frustrations you mention. What helped me get better more consistent results was partially opening the steam wand as the bellmen heats up. I read that tip on Reddit and once I started doing it my results got way better.  Basically my work flow is the following: put bellmen on medium high heat on stove with the valve partially opened. Once I hear it sputter a little I turn on my kettle and do all my puck prep. At this point I usually wait a minute since my kettle heats up quickly and the bellmen takes a little longer. I‚Äôll close the valve on the bellmen too that way it can fully build up pressure. From there I pull my shot and then the steam my milk. All in all it takes about 10 minutes.   And it is definitely easy to over or under stretch your milk. Lance Hedrick did a video on the bellmen and even he said you have to be really gentle while doing the initial stretch. Maybe try angling the steamer too? Between doing that and the valve thing my results got way better. And sorry for the long response lol.,i450an7,/r/espresso/comments/u0997t/french_press_vsstovetop_steamer_bellman_for/i464b1m/'

Whats the TLDR acronym equivalent for not long enough want to read more?? üòâ  Im curious to hear more about what the theory is behind opening the valve during heating is that to warm up the wand or something? Also how do you angle the steamer? One complaint I have with the wand is how rigid it is and how difficult it is to angle my milk jug under it. Is it okay to bend the wand a little bit to try to improve its positioning?   The way Ive been doing it is thus: 1. Turn on my stove to high heat and let the Bellman heat up ALL THE WAY (i.e. until there is steam coming out of the over pressure release hole) 2. Run a bunch of steam through the wand to flush it out (and to heat it up) 3. Stretch with the valve opened just a little bit (otherwise the steam pressure is crazy strong for obvious reasons) 4. MAYBE open the valve just a little bit more to get the vortex going  Id love to hear your thoughts on the issues with the above approach. Clearly there are issues since Ive been having so much trouble getting good/consistent results with this work flow.,i464b1m,/r/espresso/comments/u0997t/french_press_vsstovetop_steamer_bellman_for/i469844/'
i4783ge,2022-04-10 12:23:12,Ser_Klatu,u0997t,French Press vs.Stovetop Steamer (Bellman) for Producing Steamed Milk/Microfoam,Honestly I can‚Äôt speak to the theory behind opening the valve while heating. It seems to work though? It could just be in my head. But I‚Äôve noticed that it seems to heat the wand up better and makes the steam not as forceful. I still heat mine up until the pressure valve goes off too and do a quick purge before steaming my milk.    As for the angling basically I try and make it to where the steam hits the side of my jug. Using the back handle of the steamer as a guide I used to have it in the 12:00 position. Now I put the handle more like it‚Äôs at 2:00. This way the steam hits the wall of the milk jug a little better. Hopefully that makes sense. I can try and add pictures if that would help.   I have read that some people actually bent the wand or repositioned it but I‚Äôm not mechanically inclined and didn‚Äôt want to risk breaking something.  It‚Äôs a finicky thing to use. I was about ready to give up on it until I saw Lance‚Äôs video. He didn‚Äôt do anything ground breaking but he voiced similar struggles so it was validating in that regard haha.,i469844,/r/espresso/comments/u0997t/french_press_vsstovetop_steamer_bellman_for/i4783ge/'

i44xr8n,2022-04-10 00:07:07,Worried_Document8668,u05rnt,Profitec Pro 700 or 800?,A spring lever machine will produce a different flavour profile because fo how the mechanism works. It just builds and applies pressure differently.  Nothing harder to use than with a regular E61 machine.  Though an E61 upgraded with flow control can give you pretty much the same profile.  To me the main reason for spring levers is touch and looks. If you want to pull the big lever and have the space to fit the huge lever in your kitchen go for it.

i46o2wi,2022-04-10 10:07:24,lordjeebus,u05rnt,Profitec Pro 700 or 800?,There are some other advantages. If you plan on using a lever profile it makes sense to use a machine where that profile is the default and automatic. Spring levers are also quieter and cleaner. Because theres no 3-way solenoid valve theres no reverse flow and so no backflushing.  One drawback is height. The lever will block any cabinets that are above it. Changing the piston seals is also a minor inconvenience that takes about 10-15 minutes about once a year.  It should also be said that its more dangerous for someone who doesnt know what theyre doing -- you could break your jaw if you released the lever without the portafilter in place.,i44xr8n,/r/espresso/comments/u05rnt/profitec_pro_700_or_800/i46o2wi/'

i43k8gm,2022-04-09 16:44:49,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,> I mainly change the grind size to dial in  I learned to dial in using the [Barista Hustle](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/espresso-recipes-putting-it-all-together/) method of keeping the dose constant finding the yield that tastes best and finally finding the grind setting that tastes best. Note that the best yield is found prior to finalizing the grind. I find increasing the yield has a much bigger impact on reducing sourness than varying the grind.   On the page I linked check out the posts on Dose Measuring Yield Strength Understanding Yield and Time prior to watching the video. There is great advice there on how to dial in.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i43k8gm/'
i4427zg,2022-04-09 19:11:01,no_other,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,Lower your dose try an 18g dose with the same target ratio. I‚Äôve noticed the breville portafilter starts having trouble handling anything above 19g.  With proper technique and dosing the breville should be capable of pulling pretty damn good shots.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i4427zg/'
i449tjd,2022-04-09 20:14:27,maskoffcountbot,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,From what Ive seen and read here about the Bambino the engineers designed it to quickly pull a shot of dark roast on cold equipment. Because of this the water is supposedly slightly hotter than usual to account for all the cool metal acting as a heat sink when pulling a shot. You can use this info to help dial in by adjusting the temp of the basket and portafilter depending on your roast level  Dark roast? Use your basket/portafilter at room temp or even run under cold water   Medium roast? Warm them up a little also maybe pull a single shot of water thru the machine right after you first turn it on (before your prep your puck)  Light roast? Heat your basket/portafilter up real good and run a double shot of water right before you pull your actual shot,-,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i449tjd/'
i450qks,2022-04-10 00:44:17,discostu84,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,Ok went and looked through the Barista Hustle materials and feel like I was probably approaching this correctly...the author basically says dose 1st yield 2nd time 3rd. Ive followed the suggested brew conditions for my most recent beans...19.5-20.5g dose 20g yield 30 seconds (its an espresso blend dont know roast level and roasted a few days ago).  The time bit is pretty hard as most of my shots pull faster than 25s.  I think I managed one shot close to the suggested conditions and it tasted sour.  One thing I noticed in the Barista Hustle website was that it is a good idea to purge the grinder a lot.  I have a bellows on my Eureka but maybe I need to be doing more to clean it out between different beans and grind sizes?,-,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i450qks/'
i4jjbvr,2022-04-13 01:47:20,discostu84,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,Just in case anyone comes along with similar issues with the Bambino Plus I think the people that suggested lowering the dose were giving good advice. While I‚Äôm still working to get my beans dialed in really well I think results are making more sense and I‚Äôm getting better control with a smaller basket and dose. I don‚Äôt have proof but my experience suggests the Bambino might not be up to moving enough water at the correct pressure/temperature for finer grind and higher dose. Thank you folks for the advice and suggestions!,-,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i4jjbvr/'
i43hda5,2022-04-09 16:22:48,MarcTes,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,I started on a Bambino Pro on which I learned to pull shots but quickly became frustrated with it for many of the reasons you site.

i43r5pc,2022-04-09 17:40:22,discostu84,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,I will check it out. I suspected that I might be making a mistake just adjusting the grind while trying to fix dose. Basic process is to try a few shots with different yields while keeping everything else the same and then changing the grind? Once you like a yield why would you change the grind? Just minor tweaking?,i43k8gm,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i43r5pc/'
i44x27t,2022-04-09 23:59:03,discostu84,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,So this is interesting.  I pretty rapidly went to an unpressurized 20g basket.  I do have an 18g basket that I have never actually used.  My thinking was that I wanted more yielded espresso so use the biggest basket I have.  I suppose it has never been clear to me how you pick the size of the basket other than the amount of espresso you want...is there more to it?  I feel like you are saying that my machine simply may not be capable of pulling good shots with large doses?  I am guessing that roast makes a little difference in this discussion.  I have read the darker the roast the fluffier.  Maybe in those cases lower doses on a big basket are appropriate?,i4427zg,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i44x27t/'
i44ynpr,2022-04-10 00:18:04,discostu84,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,Ive been in the habit of running a shot with no portafilter/basket before every real shot.  Based on what you are saying that might be a mistake for dark to medium roasts?  I had a few questions about the specifics of heating up your portafilter/basket.  Im assuming you have to move kinda quickly to pull the empty shot through the basket and portafilter dry them off fill them with coffee distribute tamp and pull the real shot before everything has cooled down?  What about heating up one of those puck screens on the stove and throwing that on top before pulling the shot?  For that matter what about heating up the basket or portafilter gently on a stove?,i449tjd,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i44ynpr/'

Are you sure it‚Äôs ‚Äòsour‚Äô and not bitter. Does it make you want to spit it out? They say for a darker roast you want to go between 1:1 to 1:2 but i feel like that would just make it stronger.

i46gkg4,2022-04-10 09:17:49,no_other,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,This very well might be the case as you‚Äôre able to pretty consistently reproduce the problem and your prep otherwise sounds okay.

I agree about most caf√© espresso my Bambino shots were almost always better than what I encountered away from the house -  with a few notable exceptions.  However the shots I pull on my Mozzafiato are much better than I could pull on the Appartamento which were light years beyond the Bambino. That‚Äôs my personal experience with the shots to prove it.  My husband and daughter both offered the same independent opinions.

i43smg8,2022-04-09 17:52:23,MarcTes,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,Manual steam control with a much higher output a more powerful boiler and pump better group head design (E 61) with lever control‚Ä¶ and then there was manual back flushing and cleaning. The cleaning cycle on the Breville never did work properly. Though I can‚Äôt document it the post Breville machine seemed to brew at higher pressures as well. The new machine also allowed for a sort of pre-infusion which I found made some difference. The improvement in shots (texture and flavor) was dramatic. I also preferred a 58 mm porta filter/basket instead of the Breville which felt like a toy by comparison and which opened up a world of better accessory tools.  My first upgrade machine did not have a PID which I subsequently corrected with my current machine: A Rocket Mozzafiato Cronometro Evo R.,i43qn0k,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i43smg8/'
i44y3f9,2022-04-10 00:11:12,discostu84,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,Yup pretty sure sour/acidic is the correct description.  Makes my lips pucker.  I have to pull longer shots and/or go to coarser grind to get more of the bitter/astringent flavors that balance out the shot.  Im still confused about why grinding coarser is making the shot come out more sour (consistently and for totally different beans).  Everything I read suggested when the shot is sour it is most likely under extracted.  So either increase the dose or grind finer and keep the yield the same.  Ive kept the dose the same and done finer grind.  This is supposed to slow the extraction down with slower flow.  My experience has been the opposite.  Im going to read through the Barista Hustle stuff and try to reset my thinking on all of this because I think fixing the dose the way I have is probably wrong.  At least the dose is not the first thing to set when dialing in.  Im thinking based on the comments that I should lower my dose and potentially grind finer.,i43xlws,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i44y3f9/'

I have a routine put together from what I have read and seen in videos.  I dont think it is terrible but there are probably things Im doing that would make it obvious Im new to this.  Routine is as follows:  1) Weigh beans 2) grind beans into doser 3) put funnel on portafilter/basket and add ground coffee on scale 4) with funnel still attached to portafilter use WDT to swirl around coffee and reduce clumps 5) remove funnel and use finger to push middle out to sides a little 6) use a distributor to level the mound 7) tamp  Tamping was the thing that I realized I needed to work on.  I got tamps with springs that have helped me not push too hard. I do the twist while tamping (I think polishing the grinds is what its called) but I dont know if that is actually good practice.

i489qj0,2022-04-10 16:55:33,discostu84,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,Ive been doing \~20g in the 20g basket.  I will say that it is a struggle slowing the shots down enough to get to 30sec.  25-26s is ok but I feel like the crema is blonding much earlier than that end point.  Grinding finer to slow the shot down just leads to sour flavors right up until choking the machine.  Maybe 20g is just too much coffee for the Bambino to handle?  I dont think its stated but does the preinfusion on the Bambino count as part of the shot time?  I always treat it as though preinfusion is part of the total shot time.,i455s25,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i489qj0/'

i49itu0,2022-04-10 23:48:22,discostu84,u04ngk,Shot Development on Bambino Plus,They dont always come out sour.  Basically keeping the dose at \~20g there is a grind range that I can keep the sour flavor balanced out.  Im not perfectly consistent but I have some sense of settings.  If I want less sour I typically need to grind coarser which still seems backwards.  The thing that got me frustrated this weekend is that I got a new set of beans and the non-sour shot I got tasted basically the same as a totally different set of beans.  I expect different beans from different places to taste different.  Made me think Im doing something wrong.  Let me ask this...should I switch back to using a bottomless portafilter? I stopped using it because I got tired of cleaning up the mess and thought using taste would be better for informing changes to prepping the shots.  I only ever pulled a couple of shots without spraying/channeling.  When one is good at this is it rare to have the spray or is it even a regular thing for pros?,i48f3js,/r/espresso/comments/u04ngk/shot_development_on_bambino_plus/i49itu0/'

i43bvyr,2022-04-09 15:40:53,eat_the_pudding,u038kb,What espresso machine do you consider to have the best foundation to be built upon?,Thats a tough question to answer. Mods for machines tend to exist to add functionality that wasnt included from the start. Take a gaggia classic for example... there are tons of mods for it that dont exist for other machines (like the profitec 600 that another commenter mentioned) simply because the machine had relatively limited functionality to begin with. You can mod the gaggia to include a pid but you cant do that for the profitec 600 because it was a feature out of the box.  So what exactly do you want? A machine with limited functionality where some functionality can be added through mods? Or a machine that has the functionality built in from the outset with nothing really left to be done?,-,/r/espresso/comments/u038kb/what_espresso_machine_do_you_consider_to_have_the/i43bvyr/'

i431yzy,2022-04-09 14:27:48,RockOperaPenguin,u027dv,Which for me? As a beginner!,General consensus is that the Breville (which goes by Sage in Europe) is a solid machine that offers many features for the money.  Only downside is that the construction is somewhat plasticky (though by no means cheap) the portafilter size is not nearly as common and the repairability or potential for tinkering is somewhat less than other picks.    Bottom line: If youre new to making espresso you should be able to make consistent shots more easily on a Bambino Plus than any other entry-level machine.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u027dv/which_for_me_as_a_beginner/i431yzy/'
i43fp39,2022-04-09 16:10:02,bot-in-progress,u027dv,Which for me? As a beginner!,If you like tinkering with stuff I would highly recommend Gaggia Classic Pro. Tons of mod options and good resale market. It also have great build quality that can last really long time with proper maintenance. I have really good experience with my gaggia and I have just capped the pressure to 6.5 bar it is absolutely transformative experience.  If you want a disposable machine to get into the world of espresso and eventually find a upgrade I would say brevile bambino is also good.  Keep in mind the most important part of your setup is a grinder not the machine. 1zpresso makes great budget hand grinders like jx pro or j max. And if you want a electric one I would recommend to look into DF64 lagom mini or an Eureka grinder. If paired with a second hand gaggia classic it should be within your budget.,-,/r/espresso/comments/u027dv/which_for_me_as_a_beginner/i43fp39/'

i43t1ue,2022-04-09 17:55:54,kivster87,u01prl,Silenzio vs Crono?,When I got my crono years two years ago it came with the espresso burrs.

You will need a pitcher that is quite deep relative to the wand. There is a small hole on the side of that wand that add in air via venturi. You let that hole breath untill your milk is like 40-50 degrees then you submerge the whole wand so that the hole is covered completely so it stops incorporating air.   Alternatively you can pull the whole piece off and steam the traditional way but the wand may be too short so you will need a small 100ml pitcher.  Beats heating milk up in the microwave and using a French press. If the machine isent good enough you can supplement with one of thoes electric whisk things. The key is to not let the milk get above 60 deg c,i435jl0,/r/espresso/comments/u01er2/should_i_get_a_fake_espresso_machine_for_milk/i47gnt4/'

i42svp0,2022-04-09 13:21:21,MyCatsNameIsBernie,u00e63,Last Attempt...,I know you dont want to hear about grinders but you need to know that the Breville built in grinders like the one in the Barista Pro (and other Barista series) arent very good. Please stay away from those machines. If you get a Bambino you will get a brewer similar to that in the Barista Pro but you will be able to pair it with a much better grinder. If I were you Id get the base model (non Plus) Bambino and put the rest of my budget into the best grinder I could afford.  I found that learning to steam milk so that I could get great tasting microfoam was very easy even with a low-end Breville machine. But doing it well enough to make Latte Art is exceedingly hard (at least for me). Ive been trying for over 4 years and I still cant make decent art even with a dual boiler prosumer machine. But I still love the taste of my cappuccinos and lattes even if they suck visually.

i42pcp9,2022-04-09 12:55:38,AmNotLost,u00e63,Last Attempt...,I want to be straight with you. Ive been making 1 flat white per day for 5 years now. I can make great microfoam with whole or 2% milk but I still am laughably untalented at making the latte art. So lets just make sure we understand Im talking about myself here. I have used the BBE milk frother extensively as well as some other non Breville steam wands.  So I would say its easy to learn 80% about what it takes to steam milk properly for latte art. Took me maybe 10-15 tries to get to that 80%. Self teaching that last 20%? Thats tougher no matter which machine you have. Even the ones that have some kind of dumby mode that automates some of it still wont get you past that 80% mark.   If youre capable of keeping your eyes open while youre using the steaming wand I cannot imagine any of them are significantly different from each other in the Breville lineup youve listed since they all use the thermocoil. If youre looking at true single boilers or double boilers the steaming experience will change a bit.,i42msdw,/r/espresso/comments/u00e63/last_attempt/i42pcp9/'

i42mpm1,2022-04-09 12:36:35,jsm757,u00e63,Last Attempt...,Of those 3 if getting a bambino over the barista pro means you can get a better grinder then I‚Äôd go with that. It also has the option of self frothing the milk if that‚Äôs something you value. Don‚Äôt think there would be much difference between shot quality between those two. In this range if everything is on the table I‚Äôm going Gaggia classic pro for sure. I had a Gaggia classic as my last machine before my ECM. It‚Äôs more robustly built than breville. The majority is made of steel in Italy instead of stainless clad plastic like the breville. It also has a full commercial size portafilter which makes it a little easier getting accessories. The Gaggia is also very easy to work on if you need to fix it. If you‚Äôre keeping this machine for many years something will need to be replaced at some point. With the breville I believe you have to send it in for repair. With the Gaggia it‚Äôs as easy as ordering the part and screwing it in. Many videos online to help as well. You‚Äôll get good espresso with either of these brands but if it‚Äôs my money I‚Äôm taking the better built machine every time,i42lxtf,/r/espresso/comments/u00e63/last_attempt/i42mpm1/'

I feel like most people have never had good espresso‚Ä¶ or understand how different one cup can taste from the next. I feel like most people have had a shot from Starbucks which is repulsive. I feel most specialty coffee shops don‚Äôt make good espresso either‚Ä¶or depending on the barista at the least. It‚Äôs super hard to get a good shot BUT there is more info than ever with these budding YouTube channels that I think is making the general public more interested.,i42jwfa,/r/espresso/comments/tzzexm/is_espresso_getting_more_popular/i42kdrv/'

Just about everyone gets their coffee donated by the roasters and has them in their booths as guest baristas or rotating the roasters during the day. Take Marzocco. They have two stations with two different roasters and baristas that rotate throughout the day. Than all their machines on display have different coffees on each one and rotate as well.,i47x3k7,/r/espresso/comments/tzzdd8/any_other_nerds_following_specialty_coffee_expo/i481zy7/'

i4347tz,2022-04-09 14:44:01,SD_haze,tzz8ie,been a long time since I made cold drink,Its a fair question theres multiple factors  \-Cafe workload it would be bad but 1-3+ drinks a day is fine  \-Brand new unseasoned and uncoated steel burrs would be more susceptible to damage. But once the burrs are seasoned with coffee oils - or if coated that provides protection  \-Another way to reduce static but reduce total water involved is instead of spraying you dip a stir stick in water and just stir the beans.  \-Water (aka RDT) is more suggested for FLAT burrs. The Niche for example says not to do it. But also conicals in general can have less static/retention (less meaning like 7/10 static instead of 10/10),i42vttw,/r/espresso/comments/tzz8ie/been_a_long_time_since_i_made_cold_drink/i4347tz/'

Do you have your palm tamper set so that it limits the depth of the tamp? If so you may not be tamping hard enough. Make sure the tamper is fully extended so that the tamper body never hits the top of the filter basket. Or just try using the stock Breville tamper. Use a very firm tamp that fully compresses the puck.  I only saw about 16 seconds of actual flow in your video which seems a bit short.

We don‚Äôt have the space for a full espresso station in my surgery and colleagues had chosen a Nespresso Citiz & Milk for patients to self serve.

I just scored a nice second hand Nespresso aeroccino model 3192 that fits the stainless aesthetic of the Venus as well.

It works nicely and is easily cleaned the ‚Äú4 cup‚Äù version makes four small cups or one good mug of coffee which for me means two mugs of latte.

I looked into the data and found nothing conclusive (there are for example data about aluminium in drinking water in bauxit-rich areas in France no increased risk) the EU came to the same result in a major report later.

Something like a syringe or small hand pump can work or even just running the line into a water container held above the machine.   Other than that how do you like that machine? Ive always thought they looked super cool but Ive never seen one in person. Do you actually use it as a portable machine?,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzy1kz/rocket_porta_via_leaking_and_not_heating_up_or/i42dvwn/'

I‚Äôd let you know if I could get it to brew. I‚Äôve tried opening all the valves and turning it on and sucking out of the steam want and blowing through the water inlet and nothing.

i42l3eg,2022-04-09 12:25:07,Bindlestiff4142,tzy1kz,Rocket porta via leaking and not heating up or pumping.,The machine wont heat until the boiler is full and the pump needs to be working to fill the boiler so Id guess thats all the no-heat issue is.  You cant suck from the outlet side the pump is essentially a one way valve. Youve got to prime it from the inlet side. If you can safely take the outlet tube off the pump so the pump is just running into a bucket while youre trying to prime it that can help too (but careful of pressurized water plus electricity.) Sometimes its just easier to take the pump out and prime it on a bench and then put it back in. Also sometimes you do get a marginal pump that works okay but then wont prime after being run dry and you just need to replace it.,i42hyq9,/r/espresso/comments/tzy1kz/rocket_porta_via_leaking_and_not_heating_up_or/i42l3eg/'

I can effectively squirt water through this tube but when I ‚Äúfill‚Äù the reservoir the valve shuts and I can‚Äôt blow water through. The middle one(no clue what it does) and the bottom line(pump inlet I‚Äôm guessing) absolutely do not pass water as hard as I push in any configuration of the machine.,i42l3eg,/r/espresso/comments/tzy1kz/rocket_porta_via_leaking_and_not_heating_up_or/i42vg1y/'

i424x6j,2022-04-09 10:34:04,dand06,tzxu38,Appreciating coffee more,I have really been able to appreciate the coffee I drink a lot more since getting into espresso.   I‚Äôve been at it for a little over a month but have been constantly looking this hobby previously.  Quick overview and explanations:  1. Eureka Mignon Crono 2. Gaggia Classic Pro w/ 6.5 bar OPV 3. Peixoto Coffee (Medium) 4. Kahiwa Coffee (LFG VB77!!) (Dark) 5. Evermore Coffee (Dark) 6. Weightman scale (love it!)  First the OPV mod was game changer for me. I had no idea the impact it was going to have on my shots and flavors. No more coffee squirting everywhere and I can actually taste the flavors. It‚Äôs not just a sour or bitter shot anymore extremely enjoyable. Also been temp surfing as well which I have been enjoying the results of.  The Evermore Coffee has been amazing. It‚Äôs local to me suggest some of you check it out if you can. I believe they ship but I‚Äôm not 100% sure.   Kahiwa needs to be dialed in. I only took one shot which was before OPV. So I put it away until I could finish the evermore bag.   Peixoto I just got today super stoked to try it out! I believe all three will be amazing in their own ways!   Single dose and belows is a must for the grinder. I also ordered the espresso burrs but have found I do not need them at all. So they will be replacements when the time comes.   Future desires: 1. PID mod 2. Floating Water Level indicator. I cannot see my water level at all.  3. Maybe a dimmer mod. Not sure.  4. Explore some more coffee!,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzxu38/appreciating_coffee_more/i424x6j/'

i42f2b0,2022-04-09 11:42:44,Based_God_Bob,tzx17l,Is this a good deal or what would you pay?,It varies with use (mainly heat cycles I believe). Your friend probably uses their machine more. Mine is a once a day/one shot use case.   Also rubber seals wear out (more like dry out) faster than Viton or silicone so that could be a factor too.   It is pretty apparent when they need to be replaced. The machine will leak slightly at the joints. Mine gave up at the group to boiler first. Took the seal out and it was rock hard so did them all.   All and all regardless of the interval Pavonis are the cheapest machines to maintain. Even a seal kit every two years comes out to the same cost as half a dozen lattes from Sbux!,i42dpv8,/r/espresso/comments/tzx17l/is_this_a_good_deal_or_what_would_you_pay/i42f2b0/'

Another trick (I used to own this machine): increase the default preinfusion time by stopping the brew after 5 s then starting it again.

i41tcn7,2022-04-09 09:16:11,MyCatsNameIsBernie,tzvn9v,I‚Äôm at a loss,I would suggest the following sequence. Do these things one at a time.  1. Get a good espresso grinder. The least expensive you should go is 1ZPresso JX Pro ($159 hand grinder) or Eureka Mignon Notte/Manuale ($329 electric grinder). The C2 is a great brew grinder but not good enough for non-pressurized espresso. Start making espresso with good quality beans from a local roaster.  2. Depressurize your Dedica and learn to dial in.  3. Get a better espresso machine. When you reach this point come back to this sub for specific machine advice.

i41u56c,2022-04-09 09:21:30,MyCatsNameIsBernie,tzvn9v,I‚Äôm at a loss,Cheap machines run at 15bar because they dont have an over-pressure valve. The manufacturers omitted the OPV to keep the machines price down. Its true there is a pressure loss at the group but its only about 1 bar. So most machines with an OPV have that set to 10 bar to give 9 bar at the group.,i41t6ml,/r/espresso/comments/tzvn9v/im_at_a_loss/i41u56c/'
i41uibd,2022-04-09 09:24:00,ChasmyrSS,tzvn9v,I‚Äôm at a loss,Because it is a weak pump with a high maximum pressure itll lose pressure through the end of the system. But there is no way to test that without knowing your dose and greetings setting as those have an impact and there is no pressure gauge on the Dedica. For myself I grind 14g of coffee slightly coarser than espresso and the extraction time is closer to 20 seconds. It tastes great but there is a lot of channelling that is unavoidable.,i41t6ml,/r/espresso/comments/tzvn9v/im_at_a_loss/i41uibd/'
i420uya,2022-04-09 10:06:46,all_systems_failing,tzvn9v,I‚Äôm at a loss,You could definitely get a solid espresso-capable grinder with this budget. A lot of people start here along with a single-wall basket. Consider something espresso-focused from 1Zpresso Eureka or Baratza.   Used grinders are also a good option. You might be able to find something out matching a new entry-level grinder depending on your market. Regardless get something for espresso not just something affordable.   Replacing the machine and getting a grinder would be more difficult in this price range. You could pair a Breville Bambino with a 1Zpresso JX-Pro for about $500 if you feel like you want/need a better machine. You could also get manual machine like a Flair but would need to find a way to steam milk. Maybe keep the Dedica for that.  I wouldnt get too carried away yet when looking for cafe quality. Most cafes make crap espresso that gets washed out with a ton of milk. Youll be making better drinks with a little effort and objectively good equipment.,i41thgl,/r/espresso/comments/tzvn9v/im_at_a_loss/i420uya/'

i41urzr,2022-04-09 09:25:47,MyCatsNameIsBernie,tzvn9v,I‚Äôm at a loss,I used to own a Barista Express which has 12 to 14 bar pressure. In my experience the overly high pressure doesnt change the taste of the shot but it does significantly increase the risk of channeling. With my Barista Express I could mitigate the risk of channeling by doing a long pre-infusion unfortunately you wont be able to do that with your Dedica.,i41uk10,/r/espresso/comments/tzvn9v/im_at_a_loss/i41urzr/'

i41oi6v,2022-04-09 08:43:50,MyCatsNameIsBernie,tzvatw,Profitec 500 Pro PID brew pressure not going up,If you can get 9 bars with the backflush disk then there is nothing wrong with your machine. It has to be your grind. You can see the coffee gushing out of the spouts in your video. The flow should be much slower. You need to grind finer.  Light roasts need to be ground **much** finer than medium to dark. You should be able to grind fine enough to choke the machine. If you cant then look to your grinder as the source of problems.

About 75% of the shot was crema. I like to take a sip immediately after its pulled. The thick crema made that difficult for me. Too fresh is also problematic.

i412dmo,2022-04-09 05:59:37,coronafire,tzs8jt,How does flat burrs work,This article has a pretty good explanation: https://www.brewcoffeehome.com/conical-vs-flat-burr-coffee-grinder/  Flat burrs have top and bottom burrs both in the shape of a ring.   Bottom burr is on a spinning plate.   Top ring stays still has hole through center up into the hopper.  Beans enter through the centre of the top ring hit the spinning bottom burr carrier and get flung out in between the two burs.  Closest to the inside of the burrs are large breaker teeth start to break down the beans.  On the outside of the burs they become almost flat with the two burrs typically almost or even just touching on the flat surfaces for espresso to grind ultra fine.  The spinning centrifugal force and angle on the blade edges on the burrs continue to throw the grind out the sides all around the burrs where it falls to the bottom of the grind chamber.  Sweepers around the side & bottom of the spinning lower burrs carrier feed the grinds to the outlet chute.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzs8jt/how_does_flat_burrs_work/i412dmo/'

Do you just want a strong coffee product or do you want a replacement for Starbucks? Are you hoping to replicate what you get at a third wave coffee shop? Espresso is a very fickle beast and the equipment for making good products is not cheap. As a reference what you see at a good coffee shop can easily push $25k or $30k. Products under a few grand inevitably have trade offs between build quality output quality consistency ease of use etc.   I‚Äôm not trying to scare you away but I feel having proper expectations are important.

i41l8fp,2022-04-09 08:21:47,bagelizumab,tzs5x9,cheap entry level machine recs?,Just do Bambino + Eureka Filtro/Crono (optional to swap into espresso burr \~30 bucks I have heard users made espresso just fine with the Filter coffee burr so I wouldnt stress this too much esp. if you are just going to experiment with pressurized basket first early on). Its like 100-200 above your budget but I would argue this is the absolutely minimum you would want to spend for espresso.   This is way cheaper and you need way less accessories and mods to start making decent drinks than some of the other entry options that uses single boilers such as Gaggia Silvia etc.  because of temp control that comes with Bambino. And it is also a way better starting point than say a 100 bucks Delonghi just because 1. it has a way better steaming capability and 2. it has a more room to explore if you do find yourself enjoying the hobby as you go and want to experiment. Bambino has 9 bar and you can easily start experimenting after buying a non-pressurized basket using the same machine and grinder.

Heat milk then beat in a french press or wand-stir. Non-dairy milk? Then add a dollop of coconut milk will get you froth.   I love my aeropress with Fellow Prismo (~$70 together) used to be cheaper. Not quite espresso but damn close enough to save me from an splurging on an espresso machine. My comment offers quality but trades saving money for spending time.

A good solution for nice (especially milk based) coffee. Thats if you don‚Äôt want a hobby which means you probably don‚Äôt want a Gaggia or Rancilio or other type of single boiler that are going to require temperature surfing or modding.   Google James Hoffman ¬£250 and follow the link to YouTube. Thats his idea of what you can get when you buy a Gaggia grinder and get started with good espresso.

New your best bet is 1zpresso JX Pro and a (non-plus) Sage Bambino -- plus add the non-pressurized/single wall portafilter basket. This set up is completely sufficient and can easily make shots/lattes as good or better than the average coffee shop.  Used Sage has a few models out there that might work if you can find them used. Bambino BBE Infuser Duo Temp. Others worth considering used on the lower end is Gaggia Classic Rancillio Silvia Lelit Ana. -- But I sincerely suggest the new (non-plus) Sage Bambino instead. All of these machines have their pluses and minuses but the Bambino has a set of great features for an affordable price.

i41ee02,2022-04-09 07:34:30,branneman,tzrn94,Adjusting brew pressure on Lelia Mara(non x PL62T),If you can find your OPV (over pressure valve) and it looks exactly the same and its in the same spot its a very safe bet that MaraX instructions apply for you as well. If youre still unsure I would just call a Lelit dealer and simply ask them if it looks the same and is in the same place on both machines.  Make sure to disconnect the power when touching the internals. Also mind that static pressure (with a blind filter) can be slightly different from pressure generated against coffee grounds. But that should be less than 1 bar difference.  https://youtu.be/VC1DpretnZo,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzrn94/adjusting_brew_pressure_on_lelia_maranon_x_pl62t/i41ee02/'

i48161x,2022-04-10 15:49:57,Honest_Corgi9819,tzqnl6,Steaming milk with two holes,The tip of the frothing wand should lightly skip over the surface of the milk to introduce air bit by bit (and avoid bubbles). Once the milk at the top of the jug becomes warm then plunge the tip and finish steaming. There are few helpful videos on youtube from wholelattelove. Also try 2 percent because its easier to work with.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzqnl6/steaming_milk_with_two_holes/i48161x/'
i40uq04,2022-04-09 04:44:14,20sjivecat,tzqnl6,Steaming milk with two holes,The large whoosh injects a lot of air into the milk which accounts for the big blob. Youre gonna have to be more subtle only having the tip a little above the milk to inject air. Just for a few seconds until the total volume expands by maybe half an inch in your pitcher (maybe even less) and then drop it in the milk until hot.  Angle your pitcher so that from the very first moment you get the swirl breaking up any bubbles.   Youll get there just practise and practise ^^,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzqnl6/steaming_milk_with_two_holes/i40uq04/'

If you cant get the slurp/ripping paper your pitcher isnt in position. Same goes for the swirl. Practice and dont think about gear.

i47alnh,2022-04-10 12:40:33,m0znme,tzqnl6,Steaming milk with two holes,The pitcher:milk ratio is fine. I use an 8oz pitcher and never steam more than 100g of milk. With my 2-hole tip  ~1.3 bar pressure and 85g of non-homogenized whole milk I inject air for about 10s then vortex for another 15-20s. I‚Äôm usually turnng off steam just before I stop my shot.  It‚Äôs practice and learning the nuances of the milk you use and the machine. Non-homogenized milk is kind of a pain. I buy in half-gallons and notice getting proper microfoam is more difficult the longer the milk has been open - and sometimes I get a batch that just won‚Äôt foam properly.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzqnl6/steaming_milk_with_two_holes/i47alnh/'
i40rtu1,2022-04-09 04:10:18,LeiLei2008,tzqnl6,Steaming milk with two holes,If you feel more comfortable steaming with one hole it‚Äôs probably you machine has powerful steaming power. Two hole just heats up the milk too quick and you don‚Äôt have enough time texturing.   I think you can try shorter time stretching when introducing air into milk so you have more time texturing.   Or try use a bigger jug like 15oz so the process is slightly longer.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzqnl6/steaming_milk_with_two_holes/i40rtu1/'
i49nhpm,2022-04-11 00:51:03,darenju,tzqnl6,Steaming milk with two holes,Yes I know how all the process works because Im used to do it with only one hole as per my previous machine which had less steaming power.

i40v97q,2022-04-09 04:50:03,darenju,tzqnl6,Steaming milk with two holes,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm aiming for! But as I wrote I lower the pitcher really slowly and it seems to just go from loud screeching noise to the big woosh. I totally need to practice more but the result with water and dish soap sometimes is convincing but not with milk.  Also listening to sound even after getting the big whoosh the milk gets hot really fast and the sound is basically always screeching. What a tough time! I‚Äôm really thinking 6oz is too little milk for such power.,i40uq04,/r/espresso/comments/tzqnl6/steaming_milk_with_two_holes/i40v97q/'
i47hsnh,2022-04-10 13:30:29,darenju,tzqnl6,Steaming milk with two holes,For now I am actually getting an okay result. What I do is turn on the steam and immediately lower the pitcher until I get a slight slurping sound. I do this until I added enough volume and then put the tip more back into the milk to let it heat. The whole thing takes about 15 seconds I would say. Now I wonder why when I pour latte art there still are some really tiny bubbles on top of the surface ‚Äî and not only on the milk. Could it be there is a bit too much froth or I added air a bit too fast? I will keep experimenting tomorrow. Now I see that it‚Äôs actually possible to get a good result. Also I changed on which side I tilt the pitcher. I‚Äôm sure it makes a difference! üòÅ,i47alnh,/r/espresso/comments/tzqnl6/steaming_milk_with_two_holes/i47hsnh/'
i40s9my,2022-04-09 04:15:38,darenju,tzqnl6,Steaming milk with two holes,I was thinking of using a bigger pitcher. But that would mean putting more milk in it and wasting half of it if I am only doing one 150ml cappuccino at a time?  Thing is where I live the baristas use a 12oz jug with a 4-holes steam tip on a commercial machine (Faema 3 groups) so steam power while probably being a variable might not be the only culprit. Could a toroid pitcher help with getting the vortex going? For info my machine is on my user flair. Heat exchange machine 1.5L copper boiler.

However while trying to get more volume so leaving the wand where it is gives big bubbles after some time. Perhaps the whirlpool is actually too strong for such a small pitcher causing some turbulence and exposing the hole more than it should...  Will try to get a bigger bitcher (20oz ?) and report!

The adjustments you make are for the outer burr however the inner burr can also be adjusted. Problem is that they ship from the factory with different inner burr sizes set. So some machines come out with the inner burr set a ‚Äò2‚Äô while others ship with setting ‚Äò4‚Äô on the inner burr. Which results in the first machine able to use outer burr setting 12 (or anything high up) and the other machine needing to go down below 5 on the outer burr.

i405gqu,2022-04-08 23:19:34,rararajman,tzmou8,Caffeine Per Day,A few thoughts:  1. ‚ÄúDouble‚Äù and ‚ÄúSingle‚Äù shots are Italian creations from the beginning of espresso and Italians god love their coffee artistry and mastery weren‚Äôt really that concerned with standardized nutritional values. They‚Äôre arbitrary bench marks and a double is really closer to an 8oz cup of drip‚Ä¶BUT   2. You can‚Äôt really standardize coffee even if you wanted to. Robusta is about double the content as arabica but even between species it varies based on varietal and/or growing conditions (N.B.: Italians love robusta so maybe for the the single and double delimitation makes more sense) ‚Ä¶and still   3. While the caffeine content of a coffee bean can be figured out the amount of caffeine you get to consume is entirely dependent on how much caffeine is extracted. How much is extracted depends on roasting style grind setting all that jazz. As we know from this sub consistency shot to shot probably isn‚Äôt too realistic especially if switch coffees. With all that‚Ä¶  4. People are different and metabolize  coffee differently. People have different hydration habits. People have different sleep patterns. So maybe it‚Äôs more or less than 400mg.   I think It‚Äôs impossible or st less very difficult to figure out exactly how much caffeine you‚Äôre consuming from coffee. Generally if drinking arabica I think a double is about the same as a cup of drip around 100-110 mg. I personally drink 3 doubles in the morning and 2 around lunchtime.

Still plenty of OG 900 owners in the BDB modders community as well and that model is now 8-10 years old.  Really the longevity of a BDB depends how well its cared for (although this is true for any espresso machine really)--use good quality water do regular cleaning and maintenance replace the parts that are easy/cheap to replace if/when they need to be replaced.,i4130nl,/r/espresso/comments/tzmelq/need_some_big_brain_power_on_this/i41rard/'

i42438i,2022-04-09 10:28:21,blatsnorf,tzmelq,Need some big brain power on this,I particularly like the volumetric dosing which is available on very few machines.  I also appreciate that there is no water tank of any kind.  This frees up precious space inside and means one less thing to clean.  If you reach out to Clive Coffee or Chris Coffee and just ask then I expect theyd give you a discount.  Both of those also give a percentage of your purchase price back as a store credit so the cost isnt as high as it looks at first glance.,i420xqm,/r/espresso/comments/tzmelq/need_some_big_brain_power_on_this/i42438i/'

i425c1l,2022-04-09 10:36:53,dadudster,tzmelq,Need some big brain power on this,I mean not really. Speaking as someone who has heavily modded their BDB (for no other reason than that I like to tinker) there are really only 2 mods that I would consider to be MUSTS: (1) the simple slayer mod (which essentially costs nothing to do) and (2) a bottomless portafilter.  Id also recommend things like precision baskets and screens (puck and group head) a good scale a calibrated tamper etc. However those are things Id recommend regardless of the machine you bought.,i42482q,/r/espresso/comments/tzmelq/need_some_big_brain_power_on_this/i425c1l/'

My first thoughts:  If this is above $3750 it might not pick up with the home market who would normally be looking at the Decent or maybe Bianca.  I think over $4k it might be a tougher sale personally maybe Im wrong.   Absolute innovation with the water tank in the front and a rubber drink cup mat built in.    Curious if theres even an option to plumb / how the drip tray drains.  The software integration looks hella smooth and clean but standalone software with build in hardware scares me.  Theres a lot to go wrong with a touch screen build in hardware and custom software.   Fit and finish (ignoring wild color options which I think are nice) this looks like a potential upgrade for me.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzkkcx/synesso_announces_the_es1/i42iplm/'

Prices started around $10-$11000 for the one group and are too large for most home users.  However those that have the one group love them.  This new machine is made by the new owner of Synesso so the jury is still out on it.  Initially my reaction was that it looks like a Decent but I suspect if if reflects the build quality worthiness of the name Synesso its going to be a benchmark....depending on the price.  Rumors of around $5-$6000 have been common.  If hit hits this price range the it will be a huge winner in my opinion.,i40agz2,/r/espresso/comments/tzkkcx/synesso_announces_the_es1/i40h6rh/'

The easiest way to spot a render is by the light angles and the shading being slightly unnatural if you compare different parts of the image. Look at the shade angle behind the machine and then compare to the tiles.  Regarding the smudges- as others have already mentioned these are very easy to add and are pretty much expected nowadays. If anything - ask yourself - would you really have THAT MANY fingerprints on a product prepared for a photoshoot?

i404amh,2022-04-08 23:06:06,blatsnorf,tzkak8,Im so confused...,With espresso its about how long the water is in contact with the coffee how evenly it flows through all of the coffee and at what pressure.  (Edit: replaced temperature with pressure.  Temp is important but not what I meant to say.)  If you have too little coffee and/or the grind is too course then the water is going to flow through quickly at low pressure.  It might or might not contact all of the coffee.  By grinding more and/or finer itll (help) address the pressure and time issues which will also lend to the water reaching the coffee more evenly.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzkak8/im_so_confused/i404amh/'

i3zrtf4,2022-04-08 20:55:08,PeriodicallyAnnoyed,tzkak8,Im so confused...,Part of it is also a finer grind will compact more creating more resistance to flow and more resistance time of the water with the grounds allowing more extraction.

i40p8vs,2022-04-09 03:37:27,mohragk,tzkak8,Im so confused...,Espresso is all about flow. And in order to control that you use fineness in the grind to create more or less resistance to flow.

i3zvy4b,2022-04-08 21:34:28,Sasquatch0217,tzk69s,Question: does shimming the grinder give you better grind consistency? or just allows you to grind even finer? I did the marker test on my DF64 and got about 90-95% rub off so I didn‚Äôt bother shimming but now I‚Äôm curious if shimming would produce a more consistent size of grind‚Ä¶ thoughts?,The shims should just move the burrs closer together for any given grinder setting. It shouldn‚Äôt have any impact on the consistency but it will move your espresso grind window. I know with my Sette I started getting close to the 2-3 setting and shots were still running quickly. I added a shim and that moved the window back to the 9-10 range. If you can still choke you‚Äôre machine I would say you likely don‚Äôt need a shim yet.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzk69s/question_does_shimming_the_grinder_give_you/i3zvy4b/'

I did the marker test on my DF64 and got about 90-95% rub off so I didn‚Äôt bother shimming but now I‚Äôm curious if shimming would produce a more consistent size of grind‚Ä¶ thoughts?,Your Sette is conical. Shimming on flat burr grinder changes the geometry and can help grind consistency. I can‚Äôt tell what you mean by 90%. You can still redo it and place a tiny Aluminium foil to shim it and see the result. If it‚Äôs worse remove it again.,i3zvy4b,/r/espresso/comments/tzk69s/question_does_shimming_the_grinder_give_you/i403e6h/'

I did the marker test on my DF64 and got about 90-95% rub off so I didn‚Äôt bother shimming but now I‚Äôm curious if shimming would produce a more consistent size of grind‚Ä¶ thoughts?,When I did the marker test the marker was fully wiped off the bottom burr and on the top burr 10% of the marker was left on meaning it never comes in contact with the bottom burrs at its closest movable touching point.

i42rw8v,2022-04-09 13:14:10,Equivalent_Tea_8639,tzk0bd,Lance‚Äôs Dual Boiler,Possible but breville has a tendency of discontinuing parts so yes you will need to hunt for salvage machines‚Ä¶ (seriously  pick a part in a breville machine and try to order it you can probably find a dozen parts and the rest are special order or discontinued) You may also find that it is a different revision and has different parts. Just last week there was someone here looking for a replacement part for the breville duo temp and it was discontinued.  Additionally these machines are not designed to be repaired or really last more than 5 years.  BUT aside from that BDB is a great machine. If they didn‚Äôt discontinue their parts or use non standard parts it would be the best bang for your buck. But unfortunately your trade features for build quality when it comes to breville.,i42mtd6,/r/espresso/comments/tzk0bd/lances_dual_boiler/i42rw8v/'

i40okl0,2022-04-09 03:28:29,MotoRoaster,tziedc,What‚Äôs your go to ratio for trying to dial a bean in?,Higher extraction. Bear in mind it‚Äôs personal preference I‚Äôm not saying 1:2 is wrong. From Scott Rao:  MOST CAFES ATTEMPTING TO USE A 2:1 RATIO ARE UNDEREXTRACTING THEIR ESPRESSO.  The most important reason most baristas should question the 2:1 ratio is that they may be serving underextracted espresso.  By ‚Äúunderextracted‚Äù I simply mean the coffee would taste better if the extractions were higher.    Simply put if you‚Äôve got a setup such as a Mazzer grinder (low extractions) and a La Marzocco Linea (no proper preinfusion no pressure decline) and you use a 2:1 ratio you‚Äôre likely underextracting.  Using an espresso machine that offers slow low-flow preinfusion or a well-programmed pressure-profile machine and/or using a higher-extracting grinder such as a Mythos or a Peak can each significantly boost extraction quality and quantity.  Unfortunately equipment selection is another area where baristas and shop owners do more trend following than analytical thinking but more on that some other time.   HOW TO TEST WHETHER YOUR COFFEE WOULD TASTE BETTER AT A HIGHER EXTRACTION  This is not a foolproof test but it‚Äôs worth trying and takes only a few minutes.  Let‚Äôs say you typically pull shots with 2:1 EBRs using 18g in/36g out in 30 seconds.  Try this instead: set your grinder one small notch coarser.  Purge a couple of doses from the grinder. Pull a 3:1 ratio shot (18g in/ 54g out) in 30‚Äî35 seconds.  Youve now likely increased extraction by more than one percentage point.  Assuming the shot did not channel more than usual taste the coffee and evaluate whether you prefer the flavor to that of your 2:1 ratio shots.  If you were underextracting at 2:1 you‚Äôll likely find the 3:1 shot is juicier less sharp and less sour.    The test is imperfect primarily because we‚Äôve changed the flow rate but almost all baristas who have done this test with me preferred the flavor of the 3:1 shot over the 2:1 shot.,i40o41q,/r/espresso/comments/tziedc/whats_your_go_to_ratio_for_trying_to_dial_a_bean/i40okl0/'

Honestly with my JX-Pro + Lelit Anna (no-pid) I just get used to the sourness since I could not find a good balance of grinding/timing with my standard 18gr dose. I will totally try this kind of method just do see the difference. Ive tested the salami shot and totally the first one is what my palate does not like at all while second and even the third shot are much more enjoyable. So I was questioning myself DO I RLLY LIKE COFFEE or IM JUST incapable of pulling one decent shot?

When I moved out of my parents‚Äô house and into a new place she got me a moka pot as a housewarming gift. This is how I drank espresso for many years.  Then I slowly started upgrading my home espresso set-up (and drinking espresso at specialty coffee shops). Over time I mostly ditched the moka pot/cafe bustelo.   Years later I drank it at my mom‚Äôs house (black as I always had) and was surprised at how bad it tasted.   To be honest I still keep it on hand when I need caffeine and I‚Äôve run out of fresh whole beans. I use James Hoffman‚Äôs moka pot technique and let it cool for a full ten minutes.

You can use it with a hopper to grind-by-time or single dose it. If you are in the US and are willing to forgo US Warranty you can get it at a substantial discount (2/3 the price of a Niche) at EspressoCoffeeShop.com. If you are going to do this buy soon as there are reports that Eureka will be closing this loophole shortly.  The main advantage of the Niche over the Specialita is easy and repeatable adjustments. If you frequently change beans or brew methods then the Niche is well worth the extra money.

i3ymjoi,2022-04-08 15:28:10,Equivalent-Speech-13,tzeh53,Advice on first time set up,My first setup is the delonghi dedica and wpm zd-12 its a LOW budget setup but it first of all made me research *everything* from the basics (right up from what even is pressurized vs unpressurized) so I could squeeze everything for that machine. Most importantly it allowed me to see if I even want to take this hobby up.  Total cost was about 500USD and now I feel comfortable spending 2000 USD because I know this hobby is here to stay.. So my advice is get a decent machine (dedica or a bambino for instance) a grinder (doesnt have to be a GREAT one! A good manual or a cheap electric one is also good for a start) stick some needles in a cork and call it a WDT get a tamper (MIND THE DIAMETER Ive been burnt before..) and start your journey!

i3yruhz,2022-04-08 16:06:23,Aertheron01,tzeh53,Advice on first time set up,For 1200 dollars you could get a DF64 and a gaggia classic pro with PID mod and 9 bar pressure mod.  There are two things this sub has taught me: Grind finer! The grinder is more important than the brewer.  If you are hesitant about modding you could probably get a niche zero and a sage/breville Bambino.   With that grinder your good for a long time after you find your liking this hobby you can always upgrade the espresso machine later.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzeh53/advice_on_first_time_set_up/i3yruhz/'
i3yzk7y,2022-04-08 17:04:07,MyCatsNameIsBernie,tzeh53,Advice on first time set up,The Barista Express is a great brewer mated with a poor grinder. Please buy a separate machine and grinder. The other comments all have good options for you to pursue.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzeh53/advice_on_first_time_set_up/i3yzk7y/'
i3zw2zh,2022-04-08 21:35:46,tommyhateseveryone,tzeh53,Advice on first time set up,Prioritize a grinder you wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to upgrade. A niche and a bambino is a great starter setup and then you can get a big machine down the line if you ever feel the need.  Also niche is gonna be the best all purpose grinder for filter and etc so ideally it would be the only one you need. Other than the bambino gaggia classic and Silvia are both safe bets and easy to find secondhand,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzeh53/advice_on_first_time_set_up/i3zw2zh/'

i402fzk,2022-04-08 22:44:25,Equivalent-Speech-13,tzeh53,Advice on first time set up,No problem! If you have any questions feel free to ask. And I remember being extremely intimidated by this sub at first since some people here truly believe that unless you buy a 800$ grinder and a 500$ machine you cant even *start* taking this hobby up and experience espresso making.. Ill just say that if you want to see if you enjoy driving you dont need Schumachers car as your first.  I will say however as a rule of thumb low budget espresso machines typically have low uneven brew temperatures and pressures so stick to dark roasts for a start (on my opinion their tastier anyways ) ),i3ypshd,/r/espresso/comments/tzeh53/advice_on_first_time_set_up/i402fzk/'

i3yq893,2022-04-08 15:54:40,BoogerTea89,tzbpj7,Honest question on syrups and the likes,Most people drink coffee but most people arent baristas.  Most baristasdont make enough money to afford fancy home set ups but the people who pay 8 dollars a day for coffee sometimes do.  8 dollars for coffee a day comes from espresso+milk+syrup+materials and labor  Not saying this is every home espresso owner but would explain why alot have syrups paired right with thier machine  Also when helping customers to choose blends i always make thier drink of choice. I use a 22000 dollar espresso machine to make thier drink with a 6000 dollar grinder and ill put two pumps of vanilla in thier 12 oz latte because thats how they nornally drink it. People who drink vanilla lattes everyday wont drink or compare the nuances of one espresso to the next. They wont even drink the espresso by itself. If you give them a latter with two different well crafter espressos they will be able to tell you which they like better and why.   So even though they use syrup the base espresso is still important to the taste. The quailty of that espresso shot also has greater margins of acceptibility mosty likely in a flavored milk drink so it only helps to aid the user. However the machine espresso and steamed milk still make a huge impact on the result and so these high end set ups are benificial to begginer and expert users.   I drink my espresso neat and my coffee black but ill enjoy both pepsi and pepsi mango.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzbpj7/honest_question_on_syrups_and_the_likes/i3yq893/'

i3zecnq,2022-04-08 19:01:04,Noobplzforgive,tzbpj7,Honest question on syrups and the likes,Well I guess it kind of depends. Like I am so sick and tired of caffes serving me sour shots when ever Im shopping for beans trying to support local businesses. Im sure most of their customers get an iced oatmilk vanilla lattes or something and by the time they add all that syrup and milk it really wouldnt matter. But if its like super super sour shot Im sure people will still taste the unpleasant acidity in their lattes.   But at the end of the day taste is subjective. But syrups seem to work out for most people since Starbucks and the likes are super popular to the general population. Most people do like sugar lol. I think if were going to do a scientific survey most people will statistically poll towards sugared and milked down drinks over straight espresso. So I think in terms of scientifically proving this well get subjective answers depending on how we go about it since taste is subjective.,i3z21ct,/r/espresso/comments/tzbpj7/honest_question_on_syrups_and_the_likes/i3zecnq/'

i42v9qq,2022-04-09 13:38:52,CondorKhan,tzaos5,Simple Questions Thread,After a few days with my Gaggia Classic Pro and JX-Pro.. and trying to make sense of some of my observations....  First day.. calibrated the JXPro per online instructions... dosed 15 grams of light roast Ethiopia Yirgacheffe trying to achieve 1:2 ratio in a decent time. A fountain sprung forth and I got like 50g in 15 seconds. I thought it was a writeoff but it was actually a very tasty balanced drink if a little light. Went three clicks finer and now the machine was choking with nothing coming out. Sigh.  Backed off two clicks and now Im getting very fast shots but theyre quite acidic and hollow. Decided to increase the dose to 18g theyre a little slower but still not ideal. First shot was still the best one.  Bottomless portafilter and IMS 18g basket came in. Shots got massively faster and still hollow. Been grinding finer click by click and now Im doing 1:3 (possibly better for such a light roast or so I have heard) in 25 seconds which is more in range but the shots are still acidic.   I took the liberty to look under the portafilter and the last shot I pulled had two distinct streams so possibly some channeling.   Conclusion a) My distribution sucks. Maybe tamping too hard. Is that possible? Yes I have a WDT tool.   Conclusion b) I went the other way. Im grinding too fine and Im getting channeling. Maybe I should back off my grind setting to where I was originally and play with dose.   Conclusion c) This being an unmodded Gaggia Classic Pro its pushing 15 bar or so through the puck. Install that 9 bar spring when it comes in.  Are these reasonable conclusions?  At least the failed shots make nice milk drinks.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzaos5/simple_questions_thread/i42v9qq/'

i467myl,2022-04-10 08:16:56,CondorKhan,tzaos5,Simple Questions Thread,Two main differences... Profitec is dual boiler... one for espresso the other one for steam. You can steam and brew at the same time. Also theyre PID controlled so you can precisely set the temperature of each.  With the Gaggia you need to wait for the water to heat up after brewing before you can steam. Also theres no PID so nobody knows what the temperature is. Google Gaggia temperature surfing to find out how people deal with this.  In other words with the Gaggia you have to work a lot harder to get consistency and thats reflected in the price.  I got a Gaggia recently and while I dont really regret it part of me wishes I had splurged just to make everything easier.

The best you can do is get an unpressurized basket if there‚Äôs even one for that machine so you can grind finer and hopefully slow the shots a bit. Maybe try WDT to break up clumps and distribute the coffee by sticking needles or paper clips into a cork and stirring the grounds in the portafilter (only if using fresh ground coffee.)

i3xx7bs,2022-04-08 12:36:59,VibrantCoffee,tzabaa,your thoughts on organic vs non organic coffee?,Lots of coffee is grown organically but not certified organic because it costs money to get certified and most farmers arent exactly swimming in money. So no I pay almost no attention to whether a coffee is certified organic or not.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzabaa/your_thoughts_on_organic_vs_non_organic_coffee/i3xx7bs/'
i3xw0ed,2022-04-08 12:29:07,tharobc,tzabaa,your thoughts on organic vs non organic coffee?,Listen to the recent Tim Wendelboe podcast he did with Coffee Collective. Organic coffee is fine but the real sustainable choice is B-corp certification or even better coffee sourced from a roaster signed to coffee.transparency.

i3zwk93,2022-04-08 21:40:42,tommyhateseveryone,tzabaa,your thoughts on organic vs non organic coffee?,Organic is going to be better for the producers not you necessarily. These pesticides break down and don‚Äôt make it to the end product but those that have to use them suffer the consequences especially children in the area. Sure there are loopholes to getting things certified organic in bad faith but organic does ensure some of these pesticides harmful to the environment and human development are not used.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tzabaa/your_thoughts_on_organic_vs_non_organic_coffee/i3zwk93/'

i3xxp01,2022-04-08 12:40:15,VibrantCoffee,tzabaa,your thoughts on organic vs non organic coffee?,The transparency thing is a nice idea but not helpful in practice. There is so much more context needed in order for a consumer to understand if farmers are getting paid fairly or not than just a green price per pound or kg. For example I feel a lot more comfortable paying $3.50/lb for some decent Brazil than I do paying $4/lb for some Colombia because there are much better labor laws in Brazil and cost of living is different too. But most people would see $4 versus $3.50 and assume $4 is better.,i3xw0ed,/r/espresso/comments/tzabaa/your_thoughts_on_organic_vs_non_organic_coffee/i3xxp01/'
i3zwre1,2022-04-08 21:42:45,tommyhateseveryone,tzabaa,your thoughts on organic vs non organic coffee?,I wish the Onyx Coffee Labs model for transparency would just be the standard for specialty coffee.

i3xy68k,2022-04-08 12:43:24,tharobc,tzabaa,your thoughts on organic vs non organic coffee?,Yep totally agree. Coffee collective dropped the transparent pricing on their bags and instead show a % above market price (they describe it as a quality bonus) to remove the lack of context. So I received my monthly subscription today and know the Colombian farmer responsible for one of the coffees was paid 68% higher than market price.,i3xxp01,/r/espresso/comments/tzabaa/your_thoughts_on_organic_vs_non_organic_coffee/i3xy68k/'
i3y07rw,2022-04-08 12:56:53,VibrantCoffee,tzabaa,your thoughts on organic vs non organic coffee?,Right but even then is the market price giving the farmers a livable wage? Or does the 68% higher even give them a livable wage? Wed all like the answers to those questions to be yes but it is not easy to know. And then who is verifying that it was 68% above market price? Last I read about the transparency pledge they could ask you for proof of what you paid but how easy is it to photoshop a different number in if you happened to be lying? You kind of need an independent certifying body. Oh wait this is starting to sound like Fair Trade!,i3xy68k,/r/espresso/comments/tzabaa/your_thoughts_on_organic_vs_non_organic_coffee/i3y07rw/'
i3yhs7a,2022-04-08 14:54:37,Latter_Introduction7,tzabaa,your thoughts on organic vs non organic coffee?,To be honest we really want the farmers to get paid fairly and the b-corp is just good to some extent and we dont know the laborers who are not the owner get paid fairly.

Bambino Plus,At first it seemed like the drip tray was leaking as there was water under the machine a couple days later the buttons would play up after pulling a shot but would work again after being left for a few hours or more. That tipped me off that there was probably water in the panel so I took it apart found it was soaking inside dried it off and ran it to find this.   If it makes you feel better I bought this second hand on an eBay auction for like ¬£140 and I‚Äôve seen other threads with comments saying sage/breville can provide a replacement part if you quote the part number (though I can‚Äôt remember it atm),i43h5kk,/r/espresso/comments/tza4p4/is_there_an_easy_fix_for_this_bambino_plus/i43kufm/'

The SSP burrs are generally made for Mazzer Super Jollys but I would assume the bottom burr is still the rotating burr with the SJ and the top one still the stationary one.

i3xri1i,2022-04-08 11:59:25,Bindlestiff4142,tz800b,Help with API GH & KH water tester & TDS,KH is the important figure its the calcium hardness which means its how many potentially scale-forming minerals are in the water. Youd divide ppm by 17.1 to get grains per gallon which at least in the US is typically how hardness is described. Usually espresso manufacturers say 1-5 grains per gallon is acceptable usually 2 or 3 is ideal. 72 ppm KH works out to about 4 gpg so youre probably okay although somewhat on the harder side. (You might want to double check with the manual or the place you got the machine to verify what their hardness requirements are especially if its still under warranty.)  In terms of figuring out if your filter is still working youd need to check the pre-filter water to determine how well the softener is working-- if your tap water is like 10 gpg then 4 gpg post-filter is probably normal but if its closer to 5 or 6 it might need recharging. (Ive never worked with a Penguin Pitcher specifically but it looks like its a pretty small softener so it may in fact need pretty frequent recharging.)  GH is the total hardness which means its the calcium hardness plus other minerals in the water. It should be pretty close to TDS but thats with the caveat that your TDS meter is almost certainly a 0.5 salinity-calibrated meter which reads about 30% low comparted to the 0.7 4-4-2 meter which is what you want for measuring drinking water. (TDS meters also work on electroconductivity so will read differently depending on temperature.) The GH and TDS might be relevant for coffee taste and extraction issues but *generally* arent that important for the health of the machine.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz800b/help_with_api_gh_kh_water_tester_tds/i3xri1i/'

Stir a nice evenly mixed bed then tamp evenly. An aftermarket bottomless PF helps perfect your puck prep as you can see channeling/spray/flow but it‚Äôs worse for extraction on the Bambino because it doesn‚Äôt create as much heat from pressure as using the spouted PF with its black plastic insert. Use the scale and try to achieve the 1:2 ratio over 25-30s (grind grams to shot grams).

i3wudrz,2022-04-08 08:29:50,MyCatsNameIsBernie,tz5soi,ECM with/without flow control..?,I have flow control on both of my setups. For medium to dark roasts I use it for pre-infusion which I find helpful to reduce channeling. The flavor change from varying flow during the pull is very subtle and not a game changer. If you will never brew light roasts and your machine is plumbed in allowing low pressure PI then you can skip the FC.  For light roasts the result is much more dramatic. I find that very long (>30 sec) PI followed by a low pressure pull helps tame the brightness of light roasts.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz5soi/ecm_withwithout_flow_control/i3wudrz/'

i3xiy3m,2022-04-08 11:04:27,cgibsong002,tz5soi,ECM with/without flow control..?,Do you plan on plumbing in or running reservoir?

i3yhjn9,2022-04-08 14:52:56,rbpx,tz5soi,ECM with/without flow control..?,There are a few ways to use Flow Control. One is for a dynamic control over preinfusion. There are some machines now with computerized settings for preinfusion that cover the usage pretty well (Im thinking of machines like the Elizabeth). FC is also used to wane the end of the shot to imitate that of a Lever shot. As a pour proceeds the puck gets worn away and the flow rate increases. This reduces the extraction rate which is sub-optimal. A Lever operator will simply lighten up on the pressure to slow this down. Flow Control can restrict the flow to achieve the same effect.  I also sometimes use FC when Im off during dial-in. If I see quickly that the flow-rate is too high and Im going to get that 1:2 in 15 seconds I can just lower the flow-rate and save that shot (rather than binning it in the sink). I set my grinder to give a perfect espresso shot for a 18g dose with the FC slightly closed. Often Ill make a 20g Americano and I can increase the flow-rate a bit to compensate for the increase in dosage. Or I can pull out the triple basket load up a 24g dose for a monster milk drink and open up the flow-rate further.  I would never consider getting a better/bigger machine that didnt come with Flow Control. The obsession here with expensive monsters like the LMLM that dont have FC puzzles me.  You can get a FC kit for (almost) all E61 machines. Machines with the better saturated head dont support FC for some reason. Thus all those marvelous Small Dual Boiler machines out there (like the Elizabeth) dont give FC unfortunately.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz5soi/ecm_withwithout_flow_control/i3yhjn9/'

i3yfnhq,2022-04-08 14:39:53,rbpx,tz5soi,ECM with/without flow control..?,The difference between the Biancas lever and the Profitec/ECM screw type is both in the direction of force applied and length of travel. The Profitec/ECM screw is non-linear in effect - most of the action occurs nearest to fully-closed. The length of travel is 2.25 full turns... which is odd... except I guess that is the nature of the screw threading. The Bianca doesnt have anywhere near this length of travel and some have said it can be a bit difficult to hit an exact flow/pressure number that you want although I cant say if this is or isnt important or any more than an observation.  As far as I know they are both Flow Restricting mechanisms and so they can have the same effect. No doubt the difference in haptic feedback makes their use feel different.,i3y2nn2,/r/espresso/comments/tz5soi/ecm_withwithout_flow_control/i3yfnhq/'

I have great single origin beans from a local roaster my grind and dose are dialed in and the the pour was epic. I still have a solid crema even after adding all the other stuff. Sorry if Im not supposed to share this here but I thought that was what this sub is about. Im not trying to push anything on anyone this is just genuinely good in every way possible and I was skeptical at first I mean seeing the oil separate out was super weird at first until I took the first sip which blew me away.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz5ngd/bulletproof_americano_with_lions_mane_breakfast/i3x6su4/'

i3x4pa6,2022-04-08 09:35:16,Cycleguy91,tz5ngd,Bulletproof americano with lion‚Äôs mane breakfast of champions,inflict is not the right word this is actually really really good! the Lions Mane actually tastes a little bit of chocolate and is amazing in the coffee the milk and the oil make the coffee super smooth tasting. Seriously I was skeptical like putting butter in coffee sounds so weird and when I made this cup the first time and I saw the little oil pools separating out I thought it was going to be gross but after the first sip I was so impressed at how good it was. you have to keep stirring it but man it is so good when you get the right beans and the right grind and the right pour it takes this to the next level you gotta trust me.

i3xjn25,2022-04-08 11:08:51,rbpx,tz5ngd,Bulletproof americano with lion‚Äôs mane breakfast of champions,Thankyou for posting this!  I had tried whatisitcalled? bulletproof coffee. Went out and bought some ghee. OMG THAT IS DISGUSTING! Ive long used MCT in my drip coffee although I have to be careful with the amount because it can upset my digestive tract.  More recently Ive been interested in Lions Maine although I do find that $60 a month for a less-than-recommended dose is a bit much.   I never thought of putting it in my coffee. If it doesnt taste bad then that might be a brilliant addition to the mornings Americano.  Are you combining MCT and Lions Main in your cup? How much? tsp of MCT (unless you can take more) and tsp of LM?  (expiring minds need to know!),i3x6su4,/r/espresso/comments/tz5ngd/bulletproof_americano_with_lions_mane_breakfast/i3xjn25/'
i3ydrku,2022-04-08 14:26:56,Cycleguy91,tz5ngd,Bulletproof americano with lion‚Äôs mane breakfast of champions,Oh that‚Äôs funny I say that about whisky whenever anyone talks about fireball! No but usually I drink black espresso. Sometime an americano is nice cause it‚Äôs just a little less potent and definitely iced americano is my favorite in the afternoon you‚Äôll notice a dusting absence of sugar in all my drinks including this one which just has an oz of cream and you can‚Äôt taste mct oil it just changes the mouth feel a little and the mushrooms tasting like chocolate is just a bonus they‚Äôre only in there for the effect and the taste is barely noticeable anyway.,i3xyan8,/r/espresso/comments/tz5ngd/bulletproof_americano_with_lions_mane_breakfast/i3ydrku/'

i3xq7l2,2022-04-08 11:50:59,Cycleguy91,tz5ngd,Bulletproof americano with lion‚Äôs mane breakfast of champions,Thanks for the positivity I‚Äôd love to go over this. So you can see my bar jigger in the pic this is a 1/2 - 1oz jigger that I use for measuring the LM and the cream. We start with the best double shot we can pour we‚Äôre talking beans grind dose and pressure. Then I add a teaspoon of LM (which tastes slightly of coco) then 1/2oz MCT oil and 1oz organic heavy cream finally we run it under the hot water dispenser until full and stir till completely dissolved. The oil likes to pool and separate and the mane likes to settle so you will have to give a gentle stir before each sip but this is delicious. And yes I can‚Äôt imagine doing butter or ghee which just sounds gross in coffee but great in food.  Most other options like Four Sigmatic coffee come pre ground or even worse as instant coffee! Gross! this bag of OM lions mane is $16 on Amazon and has 50 doses! I‚Äôve been working on this recipe for a while and then I came up with this which is delicious and makes you feel fucking super duper like nothing can stand in your way. That‚Äôs the point right?  Good luck!,i3xjn25,/r/espresso/comments/tz5ngd/bulletproof_americano_with_lions_mane_breakfast/i3xq7l2/'

I‚Äôm experimenting with nootropics and keto coffee but all the standard options are instant coffee or pre ground which simply will not do.

The recipient is my own design I‚Äôm really into crafting cocktails and coffees and all kinds of drinks. The reason is for keto this is actually my whole breakfast it‚Äôs about 270 calories and it‚Äôs all I have in the morning and primes my body to run off of fat for fuel.   The cream is here because it has no carbs from dairy sugar and it just seemed kind of lacking without some kind of milk. I might consider dialing it back though cause now that i think about it I did have some intense ‚Äúmovements‚Äù after drinking this but it thought it was from starting keto and quitting drinking all at once. Can that really happen from just an oz of cream? I‚Äôm not lactose intolerant unless I eat like half a large pizza by myself.

i3yjkvd,2022-04-08 15:07:05,rbpx,tz5ngd,Bulletproof americano with lion‚Äôs mane breakfast of champions,Okay I just finished that Purica Zensations Mindful Breath (1 tsp) Americano with 1 tsp of MCT and ITS A HIT!  I was concerned that the cacao might be counterproductive for taste but if anything its better. The MCT did its usual thing where itll pool as quick as it can. However the cacao only added a deeper body (and a bit of flavour) to the drink. It emulsified/blended in with little effort. Ill have to wait and see how the MCT sits with me.  Good luck with the Keto. I had a friend who wanted to lose a bit of weight (he wasnt really fat but wanted to lose a couple of inches). He lost 35lbs in like 2 months! OMG I had to try this. We got the keto strips I hit ketosis pretty quick (was it 3 days?) and the diet was pretty easy. Stupidly I tried to combine this (for a bit) with Intermittent Fasting which made it burdensome. What I found shocking was that although I counted less than 100g of carbs each day (the target was 50g per day but that really is an ideal) I didnt lose much weight. Oddly Keto weight loss doesnt work for everyone. I think I stayed with it for over 7 months but managed a 10lb loss. Mind you a couple of years previous I had lost 25 lbs the hard way (of torturous dieting or not eating).   I think the world of keto but it didnt work well for me. I still keep to a low carb diet but Im only fooling myself if I claim thats 100g a day.  Even if I cant stick to the MCT (due to stomach issues) Im now adding LM to my Americanos thx to your suggestion. Its terrific.,i3yfiju,/r/espresso/comments/tz5ngd/bulletproof_americano_with_lions_mane_breakfast/i3yjkvd/'

BTW my Americano is 20g in 50g out in 37s 120ml water + 1tsp Mindful Breath + 1tsp MCT.

i3wv7v5,2022-04-08 08:35:08,KlonHarcos,tz5m2c,This mornings cortado attempt.,I think you have just enough air.

i3x8saz,2022-04-08 10:00:50,deacc,tz580u,Any machines w/ pid in the price/quality range of the Gaggia Classic Pro?,I would suggest just going with the Gaggia classic and then mod it to add a PID. Otherwise the machine that you end up with that has a PID wont come with standard 58mm portafilter.  Not an issue if you dont plan to buy accessories for it. But if you do you should factor in that cost because those accessories will be wasted when you upgrade.  Typical accessories recommendation are bottomless protafilter precision basket and a proper tamper.

At regular retail of $580 its a little bit more than a GCP but probably similar to the cost of a GCP + a PID kit.  The cons of the Infuser are the 54mm portafilter and lack or aftermarket parts. For example you can buy a 6 bar or 9 bar OPV spring for a GCP but there isnt anything on the market for the Infuser.   Im not sure which performs better in terms of temp stability. Neither the Infusers thermoblock or the GCPs tiny aluminum boiler are ideal setups.

Took me an hour on my VBM with no instructions.  > The ones Ive seen with outside PID look ugly... But inside PID is not as easy to change the temperature but wouldnt you just set the right temp and forget about it?  I mounted mine outside with a 3d printed slim case and i have it hidden set and forget. The metal boxes people use are a crime.  >Ive also read insulating the boiler and replacing the water distribution disc with a 6 hole version would be a good upgrade. Or is this going a bit too far?  I wouldnt bother. Uncommon mods for a reason.  Shades OPV mod is worth doing.  Seriously look at Gaggiuino- fitting it to my bro in laws GCP and my VBM (replacing my PID). Pressure profiling and better temp control than PID. The steaming should be much improved for GCP too. https://github.com/Zer0-bit/gaggiuino you can see the mod here https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/tvz85h/endgame_setup_workflow/  If you do just a basic PID the XMT7100 on ali express is the same as in the expensive kits.

i3xgb54,2022-04-08 10:47:48,dadudster,tz580u,Any machines w/ pid in the price/quality range of the Gaggia Classic Pro?,Yeah with price fluctuations and deals you never know exactly where these things come in at hence why I said about the same price. üòâ  As for your point on the OPV it is worth noting that you can pretty easily swap out the vibe pump on the Infuser to use a brass vibe pump and brass OPV which gives you the same level of control (more actually) as the GCP springs.  The 54mm basket is admittedly not as ideal as the 58mm on the GCP however its definitely the 2nd most common size so its not like its THAT hard to find aftermarket upgrades in that size.

I dont know about you but Ive never had need to go above 204 even with my lightest roasted Geisha beans.   If anything the limitation to me would be on the bottom end. I have a BDB and I regularly adjust my temperatures based on the type of bean Im using (e.g. I do 192F for decaf and darker roasts). However 196-204 covers MOST of the coffee drinks I make (e.g. lattes with medium beans allonges with super light roasts etc.).,i3xi4qd,/r/espresso/comments/tz580u/any_machines_w_pid_in_the_pricequality_range_of/i3yhyih/'
i3yk66r,2022-04-08 15:11:17,Spread_Liberally,tz580u,Any machines w/ pid in the price/quality range of the Gaggia Classic Pro?,Ah yes the manuals stated brew temps...  I suppose I wouldnt have much to complain about IF they could reach close to that temp in the portafilter.  Perhaps the thermojets in the Bambino are a lot better than the Barista Pro but Im not getting anything close to those temps when measured inside the portafilter.  There seem to be a decent number of people on the youtubes that have had the same experience.    My hack is to run the steamer for about thirty seconds and start the brew immediately (with a portafilter that had been preheated in boiling water). With the brew temp set at its highest I get about 194 in the portafilter.  If I dont do that I get about 180-190 in the portafilter.    Edit: I would love to buy a new thermojet to swap out with mine just to check but Breville will only sell those parts to an authorized service center and I havent found one that will sell to me.  This is another reason why I would be wary about purchasing another Breville machine for myself.  I like to perform my own repairs and mods and I like to be able to buy the necessary parts.    Dont get me wrong I love my machine and I think it does fantastic for what it is - but the thermojet machines are not modder machines.  If OP likes to tinker and try weird things these arent the right machines.  However if OP really wants an easy machine thatll put out a good shot along with a good steamer one would work just peachy.,i3yhyih,/r/espresso/comments/tz580u/any_machines_w_pid_in_the_pricequality_range_of/i3yk66r/'

i3wpk3y,2022-04-08 07:58:57,dadudster,tz4ytb,Cannot dial in the tang flavor.. at wits end & discouraged.. .. help?,In my experience African light roasts tend to do a bit better at higher extraction ratios. Have you tried doing a 1:2.5 or even 1:3 ratio?  What has typically worked for me with that type of bean has been doing a 1:2.5 ratio at 200F. If possible try to do an extended pre-infusion too. Personally I get the best results from a blooming shot but I dont believe pressure profiling is possible on a Silvia.  As for tang though I find that African light roasts always tend to have kind of an astringent follow through on the pallet. When balanced it plays well with the fruitier front notes but thats just been the nature of those beans in my experience. Dont quote me on this but I believe this comes from a cross pollination between Arabica and Robusta varietals thats more prevelant in that area of the world. If thats not the flavor youre looking for lighter roasted South American beans tend to be MUCH fruitier without having that bitter finish.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz4ytb/cannot_dial_in_the_tang_flavor_at_wits_end/i3wpk3y/'

When you pull the shot the temp at the location of the thermocouple for the PID goes down to 215 but the actual water being delivered to the group head is probably higher. The normal location for the thermocouple is near the cold water input from the water tank and can inaccurately reflect the overall water temp. Try the styrofoam cup trick to see what is the temp coming to the puck (i.e. preheat the group head then measure the temp of water in a styrofoam cup).,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz4ytb/cannot_dial_in_the_tang_flavor_at_wits_end/i3y9g8e/'

i3wujf8,2022-04-08 08:30:50,point03108099708slug,tz09yf,Recommendations for an all in one home machine,I‚Äôm going to have to agree with most other posters here and I share u/notheaststeeze ‚Äòs sentiment.   It sounds like you‚Äôre asking for the following to use an analogy   ‚ÄúI want the fastest production car around the nurburgring.‚Äù - Okay that‚Äôs going to run you about $600k  ‚ÄúI want it to be cheap.‚Äù - Okay then that‚Äôs going to be about $15k but it‚Äôs **not** going to be fast. At all.  ‚ÄúI want it to never break down.‚Äù - Umm okay the cheapest Toyota is about $20k still going to be slow though.   ‚ÄúI want it to do everything.‚Äù - Umm‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúI also don‚Äôt want to make this a hobby.‚Äù - Well then‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúI also want near professional level capability in the car.‚Äù - Okay look‚Ä¶  I think you get the point? I‚Äôm not saying you have to shell out thousands of dollars but what you‚Äôre asking for needs **a lot** of compromise.   If you‚Äôre only willing to spend about $600 give or take like other posters I‚Äôd tell you that you‚Äôre not going to get what you‚Äôre asking for in your original post.   Based on some of your other comments it looks like quality is far less important. As is turning this into a hobby which - for many or most - it just sort of naturally becomes.   I think you‚Äôd be far better off with a fully automated machine be it an actual fully automated espresso machine which aren‚Äôt necessarily that cheap or nespresso machine.   My reasoning why is that far more important than just the quality of your machine is you. How good and consistent you can pull shots. And a cheaper machine makes this more difficult sometimes substantially.   What also makes it more difficult is if you‚Äôre not willing to spend the time learning about techniques refining them and spending time trying to actively practice getting better at them.   I‚Äôm willing to bet regardless of what anyone‚Äôs position here is on what you‚Äôre asking for they can **all** tell you how much time they‚Äôve spent trying to pull a better shot. And how difficult that is on cheaper machines and cheaper grinders.  Not that you can‚Äôt pull really high quality shots on cheaper pieces of equipment but it makes consistency much harder.   Same with the quality of your beans of course. Personally the quality of Starbucks and Pete‚Äôs to me are both akin to Folgers.   Quality third wave roasters is where you‚Äôre going to notice a difference in the quality of their beans. Which is going to have a massive impact on how good your shot is.   Can you get quality results with the breville you want to buy? Yes. But how much time and effort you put into it is going to matter. You‚Äôre also going to have to realize that consistency might be an issue.   Even professional baristas that pull hundreds of shots a day on a strata dump shots because it was a bad pull and they aren‚Äôt just going through the motions. They‚Äôre constantly paying attention to deliver the closest to perfect shot they can each time.   Just my two cents.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz09yf/recommendations_for_an_all_in_one_home_machine/i3wujf8/'

i3vvthn,2022-04-08 04:09:22,AmNotLost,tz09yf,Recommendations for an all in one home machine,I suggest not bothering with the Barista Express. The (non-plus) Bambino is what you want. And buy the unpressurized basket to go with it.  Then buy a separate grinder. The mignon specialita Niche Zero 1zpresso JX pro and DF64 are probably the way to go if youre staying in a budget.  Dont get a different grinder than above unless someone here recommended it. The Breville SGP and Rancillio Rocky are examples of machines people buy for espresso that honestly is probably a misstep in my opinion. Ive used the Rocky. Ive used the SGP. They are riiiiiiight on the line between adequate and not adequate for espresso machines when youre not using a pressurized basket.

i3x5u8w,2022-04-08 09:42:23,StockRaker,tz09yf,Recommendations for an all in one home machine,I recommend the breville barista pro. That‚Äôs what I have used for the last 6 or 7 years. The first two did not last long because I was clueless and knew nothing about water quality. I‚Äôm my third unit my abilities changed. I use RO water with coffee lovers remineralization i only use freshly roasted beans I weigh my beans for single dosing I weigh my output. My espresso making is now a hobby. I‚Äôll be upgrading to a $3k+ machine and either a niche zero or Option-o P64.

i3wflyx,2022-04-08 06:53:39,Professional_Gap_371,tz09yf,Recommendations for an all in one home machine,I have the breville you‚Äôre looking at and Im not an expert but I don‚Äôt think I have any complaints really. The water needs to be refilled a lot. Im not sure what all the complaints with the grinder are about I dialed mine in for 19gr and get good pressure extraction crema? I think? Seems consistent to me ü§∑üèª.. I‚Äôve never seen the need to refluff the grounds with fine needles before I smash the hell out of them but to each his own. Maybe the screen ontop I could see for keeping the group head cleaner or more even pressure but Ive not had any issues there either. Ive had mine for awhile now and I think its a decent value unless you can find a deal on some highly recommended machines or have a bigger budget. I mean most people would think Im crazy for spending $500 on a breville. Imo it might be an ok place to start and if you enjoy it you can always upgrade later on if you want something more expensive.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz09yf/recommendations_for_an_all_in_one_home_machine/i3wflyx/'

i3wdcty,2022-04-08 06:38:00,varro-reatinus,tz09yf,Recommendations for an all in one home machine,The desire for an all-in-one espresso machine is typically going to lead you toward superautos some of which can even sort of steam milk. I tend to think superautos represent a poor compromise but there is a place for them in the world.  I take it from the interest in the Barista Express though that youre open to the idea of grinding and tamping yourself i.e. a semi-automatic workflow. If that is the case the BES870XL ~$700 USD isnt very good value for money in acquiring a home semi-auto setup.  To put it plainly the only advantage that Breville offers you is aesthetic: putting the grinder and the machine in the same case which is I think what you mean by all-in-one.  For a couple of hundred more you could get a separate semi-automatic machine and grinder (e.g. a Gaggia Classic/Lelit Anna and a Eureka Mignon model of your choice or DF64) that will produce better coffee more consistently over a much longer time and be much more pleasant to use and own in general. They are flat out better than what Breville/Sage puts inside that box-- and the box means you cant upgrade either part independently.  If you can grind by hand you can save a couple hundred with a good espresso-capable hand-grinder. (There Id suggest the 1zpresso J-Max which has even better stepping and value than the JX-Pro.) Personally I love hand-grinding for the same reason I love lever machines: the more hand in the process the better.  My own suggestion for you (in that rough budgetary range) would be a J-Max and a La Pavoni Europiccola but I do recognise that manual grinding and manual machines arent for everyone and can be somewhat challenging to learn even for those who are interested. To my mind the pleasure of use and the quality of the coffee are absolutely worth it and the learning curve is nowhere near as steep as its made out to be.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tz09yf/recommendations_for_an_all_in_one_home_machine/i3wdcty/'

i3wqhi9,2022-04-08 08:04:57,varro-reatinus,tz09yf,Recommendations for an all in one home machine,You may get hung out to dry but not simply for pointing out superautos as an apparent convenience. I mentioned them others have as well.  The trouble is that home superautos generally (and the 2200 specifically) dont make very good coffee for what they cost and arent really more convenient in sum only at the point of dispensing coffee. What they do is make a pretty feeble simulation of espresso at the push of a button and shift the burden of the workflow from prep to end-of-day and end-of-week cleanup.  (And NB Im not saying youre wrong for liking your 2200 Im glad youre enjoying it. What Im saying is that recommending it especially to OP is problematic.)  If you want maximum push-button convenience and dont mind sacrificing quality in the cup Id always suggest a Nespresso machine and good aftermarket aluminum pods. There you have relatively little waste (aluminum pods can be recycled) practically zero cleanup and the in-cup results are even faster and not meaningfully worse than most superautos. The pods are marginally more expensive per cup but the machine is cheaper.  I have had good coffee from superautos but they were vending machines in size and actual function in the Italian rail system. These were massive immensely expensive beasts producing huge amounts of coffee and receiving regular servicing.  Youre also quite fortunate that you have a two year-old superauto and no issues. Some will last very well without problem many of the same brand and model break down quite fast with even gentle use. Its a crapshoot and a lot can go wrong inside that little box.  In this case OP seems cool with the semi-auto workflow of the BBE so I dont think a superautos on the table really but for the odd desire that all the parts should be in the same case.,i3wazdc,/r/espresso/comments/tz09yf/recommendations_for_an_all_in_one_home_machine/i3wqhi9/'

For me personally I wouldn‚Äôt buy one if I only had one option. But I have a friend that is into espresso as anyone else on this sub. He‚Äôs had a mini linea for 9-10 years at this point (or whatever it was then) and I‚Äôm not sure what grinder he has but it was at least $5k.   But he also has a fully automatic in another location that just makes like easier. He can easily afford whatever the best possible set up is on the market currently but he doesn‚Äôt care **that** much.   Sometimes ease simplicity and speed coupled with good enough are all that someone wants. Nothing wrong with that.   Whether espresso drinkers wants to admit it or not many **are** elitist snobs very similar to elitist snob wine drinkers.   Am I a snob? Yes of course. Am I elitist though? No I get that not everyone cares as much as I do or I‚Äôll drink bad coffee if that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs available. Whatever it‚Äôs fine. If it‚Äôs bad enough I‚Äôll then go out of my way to find something good.   But my life doesn‚Äôt revolve around espresso my day doesn‚Äôt depend on how good my morning shot was or even if I had one.

If your budget doesnt allow you to escape Breville (because their machines have brilliant design and good price) then thats fine. However as magic isnt a real thing the quick cheap quality triangle still hold - choose any ***two***. You can call Breville an inexpensive option. You can say they have unmatched features for the price. You cant say they last forever. In fact in my experience youve got a good solid two year window of use before it breaks. This was true of my Breville Oracle espresso machine. This was true of my Breville Tea Maker. This was true of my Breville Convection Toaster Oven.

i3vdxfn,2022-04-08 00:21:54,Z1337M,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,i always prefer a dual boiler over a HX machine.  so yeah go with the Pro300 - or the PL92T - this one also has the PI feature.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyxi7c/profitec_pro_300_vs_lelit_mara_x/i3vdxfn/'
i3w1qu1,2022-04-08 05:07:01,kjr51922,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,I‚Äôve had the PP300 for about three years now. It‚Äôs been fantastic - zero issues. Definitely don‚Äôt need preinfusion for dark roasts. And temp stability is going to be more important with dark roasts because dark roasts brewed at really high temps are undrinkable IMO. Also I brew mostly light roasts and the lack of preinfusion hasn‚Äôt been much of an issue.   The 300 is very temp stable and recovers very quickly. You could make 20 back to back espressos without issue because the boiler gets back to temp faster than any realistic prep time.   Can‚Äôt speak to the Mara but you won‚Äôt be disappointed if you go with the 300.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyxi7c/profitec_pro_300_vs_lelit_mara_x/i3w1qu1/'
i3w4vm3,2022-04-08 05:33:42,tankplanker,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,Reason I chose my MaraX is because its very compact and its very low fuss to make repeatedly good shots. I came from a Flair were everything was manual and consistency required a ton of work I had enough of that and wanted a simple as possible especially as other people in my house want to be able to make coffee  If you like to get the last few percent out of your beans by tweaking temperature by half a degree or adjusting pressure during a shot the MaraX is not for you. Although you can add on flow control you will have to choose between adding in a brew head temp gauge (essential for me to make sure I know if I need to flush to get to the right temp at the grouphead) or a pressure gauge or drilling in another hole in the group head to have both.  The tank isnt massive on the MaraX I would typically want to top it up after four cappuccinos or risk running out of water it lacks a gauge to show you how much you actually have. That is with some flushing before and after shots pre warming the milk jug and so on.  Steam before or at the same time as pulling a shot is not something I like doing either I get much better pressure for the milk after pulling a shot in brew priority mode.  I really like mine but it does come with some compromises.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyxi7c/profitec_pro_300_vs_lelit_mara_x/i3w4vm3/'
i3vdblx,2022-04-08 00:14:12,Worried_Document8668,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,Since espresso quality is your focus the Pro 300 takes it.

i3vjphr,2022-04-08 01:37:13,UniqueLoginID,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,Dual boiler beats heat exchanger in my opinion.   No PI from the e61 is a downside short term but also a blessing if you want to leverage an open source project later for pressure profiling and preinfusion. I‚Äôll likely have to ‚Äúlock‚Äù my e61 when I fit Gaggiuino to my machine.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyxi7c/profitec_pro_300_vs_lelit_mara_x/i3vjphr/'
i3vmaen,2022-04-08 02:11:47,oneblackened,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,Of the two Profitec. I sat this as someone who owns a MaraX. Its the best heat exchanger on the market but almost any dual boiler you can think of is superior.   That said right around the price of the Profitec is the Rancilio Silvia Pro X. It has PID control of both boilers a larger steam boiler separate brew and service boiler pumps... Generally all good things.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyxi7c/profitec_pro_300_vs_lelit_mara_x/i3vmaen/'

i4088bn,2022-04-08 23:52:23,macevac,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,mara x does however tell you with a light when the tank is empty.  also it wont let you pull a shot unless there is enough water available to to do so - its actually pretty good with respect to water tank management,i3w4vm3,/r/espresso/comments/tyxi7c/profitec_pro_300_vs_lelit_mara_x/i4088bn/'

i409n65,2022-04-09 00:10:19,tankplanker,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,Yeah but it too late if it tells you that mid way through make a flat white as you got to fill it and then wait for it to heat up again.

i3wo56g,2022-04-08 07:49:49,kjr51922,tyxi7c,Profitec pro 300 vs lelit Mara X,For years 1-5 it‚Äôs definitely not 100% needed provided that your retailer tests the pressure before shipping (most do). But the Pro 300 has the build quality to potentially last 20+ years and once you start replacing components and especially the OPV the lack of brew gauge can be a problem.   I‚Äôm hopeful that I‚Äôll be able to find a scace to borrow when that time comes for me.   The other consideration is that a lot of the more modern espresso techniques involve lower brew pressures (turbo shots etc). Without a gauge it‚Äôs difficult to play around with those techniques if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre into.,i3vdun4,/r/espresso/comments/tyxi7c/profitec_pro_300_vs_lelit_mara_x/i3wo56g/'

i49f10w,2022-04-10 23:00:57,MarcTes,tyv267,My bambino plus stopped working,Yes.  To be honest I bought the Appartamento because it was the only serious machine that would fit under my low kitchen cabinets.  Subsequently Rocket released an updated Mozzafiato that just barely fit and I have been much happier with that. Bottom line: if it had been available at the time I would have gone directly to the Mozzafiato and skipped the Appartamento.  (The Mozzafiato is twice the price however.)  The Appartamento is very nice and compact and is a good training machine but it lacks a PID which turned out to be a bigger deal for me than I anticipated - yet I know of people who love it. The Mozzzafiato also has a rotary pump which is quieter more reliable and produces more even pressure.  With the Appartamento I refined my skills and learned to use a more serious espresso machine so that after a year I was able to take full advantage of the Mozzafiato.  I‚Äôm not sure about resale value as I haven‚Äôt yet sold my Appartamento.  I‚Äôd check eBay.,i49djjq,/r/espresso/comments/tyv267/my_bambino_plus_stopped_working/i49f10w/'

i3x9ykg,2022-04-08 10:08:08,fatherofraptors,tyv267,My bambino plus stopped working,I dont personally own a dual boiler but Ive used a friends. It feels better than the Bambino due to the additional weight. From a workflow standpoint it doesnt make too much of a difference to me to justify the $800 over my Bambino Plus. The dual boiler shines more when you got more drinks to make than just one...   Also it can definitely extract at higher temperatures with the boiler than the thermojet on the Bambino. If you drink lighter roasts that is a good advantage.,i3x9bxn,/r/espresso/comments/tyv267/my_bambino_plus_stopped_working/i3x9ykg/'

i3u9cyl,2022-04-07 18:12:29,equanimity89,tyr1fm,BES920 owners how much vibration/noise/shaking is normal?,In addition to the pump recommendation the solenoid can get pretty loud later in its life. I replaced part of the solenoid when mine was loud and kind of buzzy (it was cheaper and faster than ordering a full replacement!). It worked fine but no one needs that kind of grating loudness first thing in the morning haha.  I made a post about it so if you think that might be an issue you can check out my user info.

i3v03n1,2022-04-07 21:46:35,dadudster,tyr1fm,BES920 owners how much vibration/noise/shaking is normal?,Certainly it could be the pump like others have said but I think unless youre having issues with pressure its probably not worth replacing the pump.  That said you can buy brass pumps and a brass OPV and theyre A LITTLE BIT quieter although its not a hugely significant difference.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyr1fm/bes920_owners_how_much_vibrationnoiseshaking_is/i3v03n1/'

i3yshod,2022-04-08 16:11:07,plenty_nz,tyr1fm,BES920 owners how much vibration/noise/shaking is normal?,Every machine is on its way to failing from the moment you open the box. The good news is that failing usually just means one part needs replacing so its generally no big deal!  I have recently traded in an ECM Giotto HX for the BDB and found the new BDB slightly quieter ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. That said I suspect the pump in the Giotto was the original and due for replacement.  If I was you Id probably just throw in a new pump to see. They are relatively cheap and it might just solve your problem.  Edit: One more thought. Breville does some interesting things with the vibe pump in the BDB to control the preinfusion pressure. This may well lead to accelerated wear.,i3v2zmd,/r/espresso/comments/tyr1fm/bes920_owners_how_much_vibrationnoiseshaking_is/i3yshod/'

Tonic water is basically club soda (i.e. sparkling mineral water) with sugar and a little bit of quinine which is very bitter and has a distinctive flavor.

i3xqwvu,2022-04-08 11:55:35,takenusernametryanot,tyqzrb,coffee soda,not sure what is not great about it for bed evenness. They say by tamping you have to make sure you push out the small airpockets. Whether it is done once or twice shouldn‚Äôt make a difference. Anything that is compact enough would not be squeezed more no matter how many times you try to tamp. The WDT might only compact the upper part but for above reasons I don‚Äôt see an issue with it. Anyway I have done empirical tests to compare and this is my preferred method. At the end of the day the taste matters,i3xq7bc,/r/espresso/comments/tyqzrb/coffee_soda/i3xqwvu/'

Im not trying to stop you just giving you information. As for your reply youre tamping twice which is not good. Also by spinning your wedge youre unevenly compressing certain parts as the wedge spins around to each area. It pushes things around in a circle and doesnt simply compact things downwards like a leveled tamper would. Wedge tools are satisfying to use but thats really it.,i3xqwvu,/r/espresso/comments/tyqzrb/coffee_soda/i3z5wb5/'

i3uglaw,2022-04-07 19:04:34,gotshrimp59,tyq2ud,Best Non-espresso Grinder,Depends on your cup preference and what youre looking for and budget. I have a lagom mini HG-1 Plus specialita JX-Pro K-Plus Ode + SSP brew Encore and Ill be honest I find myself using the Ode + SSP the least  Flat vs Concial is the biggest decision  **Flat**  **Fellow Ode or DF64?**  **Pros**  \- Clarity in the cup from better grind distribution. Hits really specific flavor notes but the finish falls off faster than conical  \- Electric motor  \- Possibly upgradable (Ode + SSP)  \- If you get an ode they do fellow drops (text service) where you can follow brew recipes from. I personally dont follow the recipes though  **Cons (from most annoying to least)**  \- Much higher retention and static on the lower budget range  \- Alignment  \- More expensive  \- Can be monotone in the cup... Yeah this is the least annoying... I keep a vaccum next to my ode... But if you dont like chaffe in your cup at least itll end up on your table instead  &#x200B  **Conical**  **1zPresso K-Plus Comandante Encore Lagom mini**  **Pros**  \- More complexity. Grind distribution range gives you a broader range and for some coffees this can hit multiple flavors which give a cup a lot of life  \- Cheaper (especially hand grind options)  \- Very low retention because gravity  **Cons**  \- Can potentially muddy your cup if distribution is too inconsistent  \- Cant upgrade to better burrs (at least that I know of)  &#x200B  I want to point out flat bed vs conical filters. In flat bed filters you can chase a more even extraction. Paired with conical burrs this can get your very clear flavors with lots of complexity. You can also do conical filters with conical burrs at low temps on light roasts to chase super fruity and complex cups if thats your style too.  Lastly its worth mentioning that handgrinders are not inferior. Du Jianing (Brewers cup champion 2019) uses a comandante c40. Tetsu Kasuya (Brewers cup champion 2016) uses a hario hand grinder. Ply Pasarj from Rogue wave coffee (Brewers cup Canadian champion 2020) uses a 1zpresso k-plus Patrik Rolfe (Brewers cup Sweden champion) uses I think a c40. Hand grinders are a great way to get a good brew cup,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyq2ud/best_nonespresso_grinder/i3uglaw/'
i3uudqe,2022-04-07 20:53:41,Acaconym,tyq2ud,Best Non-espresso Grinder,So for pour over to get really clear expression of flavor notes and high extractions that still taste good and don‚Äôt stall you want very high uniformity grind. Fines are the enemy as they easily overextract stall the brew and muddy the flavors together. With a few exceptions this means flat burrs. There are a number of flat burrs which excel at filter coffee in the home grinder space and more in the shop grinder space. Some noteworthy contenders are the SSP 64mm multi purpose (MP) burrs which will fit in a number of different grinders like the fellow ode df64 mazzer super jolly or lagom p64. The ditting 54mm steel burrs found in the baratza vario w+ and forte bg are similar in the cup and will also fit in a mahlkonig x54. Those are the ones I‚Äôve used there are others including many offerings in the multi-thousand dollar range. Point is the burrs are the thing that matter then you pick the grinder you like that can accommodate your desired burr.   There are also some well liked conicals like the commandante c40 or some of the pacific rim grinders which are sorta ripoffs of the c40 burr. I‚Äôm pretty fond of my 1zpresso q2 heptagonal though I did have to wait a month and a half to get it from aliexpress.   This is not an exhaustive list but should point you in the right direction.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyq2ud/best_nonespresso_grinder/i3uudqe/'

i3tyx50,2022-04-07 16:55:57,aman1791,tyq2ud,Best Non-espresso Grinder,My vote is the Baratza Virtuoso or the Fellow Ode depending on your burr preference! Anything more is really overkill in my opinion. I‚Äôve been using the Virtuoso for years with no issues at all.  If you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs super solid and the absolute best bang for your buck check out the Barataza Encore.  A cheap option that works pretty well is the capresso infinity. I used one for awhile before I upgraded to the Virtuoso.  Edit: I didn‚Äôt see that you were looking for the best.

Some even consider the Virtuoso overkill for these applications and rely on the Encore but the Virtuoso allows for a wider range of grind settings so I think it‚Äôs worth it.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyq2ud/best_nonespresso_grinder/i3u402z/'

i3xwxag,2022-04-08 12:35:08,PCLoadLetter82,tyozjv,Lucky to pick this up for $800. Big upgrade over the Gaggia.,That would be weird if the boiler couldn‚Äôt handle a single shot without dropping temp even without a PID. I tinkered around with mine quite a bit but even stock and with my limited understanding of how it works it would mean that somehow either your boiler wasn‚Äôt up to temp (should be in 5 min) or that you were purging/flushing a good amount of water from the boiler before pulling the shot. The boiler is about 100ml or so so should have enough for two shots back-to-back with only a little room to spare in between for flushing.,i3x7uzd,/r/espresso/comments/tyozjv/lucky_to_pick_this_up_for_800_big_upgrade_over/i3xwxag/'
i3xxaup,2022-04-08 12:37:39,dbcooper4,tyozjv,Lucky to pick this up for $800. Big upgrade over the Gaggia.,I‚Äôve seen videos here of people with PIDs installed on their Gaggia Classics. You can see the temperature dropping that much just cycling the boiler for 30 seconds. You aren‚Äôt accounting for thermal mass. The E61 group has about 9lbs of metal with brew water thermo syphoning through it at all times to provide temp stability.,i3xwxag,/r/espresso/comments/tyozjv/lucky_to_pick_this_up_for_800_big_upgrade_over/i3xxaup/'
i3xxsbz,2022-04-08 12:40:52,PCLoadLetter82,tyozjv,Lucky to pick this up for $800. Big upgrade over the Gaggia.,Absolutely but I think it‚Äôs because of where the temp probe is. The real measure of consistent temp is at the group head and naturally without a temp probe there the next best gauge would be the output espresso itself. From beginning to end of my shots I‚Äôd always get a consistent temp. I even split the shot glasses between first and second half and the temp was the same.,i3xxaup,/r/espresso/comments/tyozjv/lucky_to_pick_this_up_for_800_big_upgrade_over/i3xxsbz/'
i3xz5td,2022-04-08 12:49:55,dbcooper4,tyozjv,Lucky to pick this up for $800. Big upgrade over the Gaggia.,In this video with something similar to a scace device you can see the temperature drop by as much as 6.3C while cycling the boiler at a flow rate similar to pulling an espresso shot.  https://youtu.be/LaqXei2v4hA,i3xxsbz,/r/espresso/comments/tyozjv/lucky_to_pick_this_up_for_800_big_upgrade_over/i3xz5td/'

How long do you grind yours for?,Ok so to clear up any confusion all the Troll responses are folks thinking you were asking a bogus question. Its essentially scripture here that grind fineness is the key to good espresso and that grind fineness consistency and quality comes from great burr grinders....which your grinder Im sorry to say is not. Does that mean you cant continue your espresso journey using an electric blade grinder? No it just means your learning curve and results will be different than those using more appropriately designed grinders (lower temp generating precision stepped conical/flat burned etc).  To your question though perhaps try grinding your portioned out beans in multiple batches to assist with grind fineness consistency. Fewer beans in the hopper means each blade rotation will chop (yes chop as these are blades not burrs) each bean more and therefore get the beans to the desired fineness faster and more evenly than if theres a larger volume of beans in the hopper all together.

From everything Ive read its a pain in the ass to deal with so I would recommend doing everything else and seeing if your problem clears up just to avoid this. People use oil filter tools to take it off and put it on (just make sure to get one that goes both ways). The La Pavoni Lever Owners group on Facebook is a treasure trove of information if you need more specialized help.  ETA: if you choose to remove it and have some extra tools to put to use some people have made a wooden holder to clamp it in a vice to make removal easier.

The wedge seems to be the prefered design among those using levelers/distributors. In fact La Marzocco are using it in their demos and they are using it to level/tamp at the same time.  >I see plenty champ baristas using one.  ...And there is also plenty of them bashing it. My favorite extensive and trustable data collecting about different aspects (shape design etc) is from Matthew Perger and the overall conclusion is...I wont spoil haha ! Go read about it it is an interesting and well documented experience from him in the levelers/distributors experimentation.  Levelers/distributors debate will never end but if you like to read more interesting things than I do one-third of a tap or butterfly wing flapping creating cracks in the puck there is still people having fun with the science of coffee and there is good readings on the internet from both sides. But I am one who skipped on the use of levelers/distributors because at best I was collecting just the same data/taste as not using it. But I do love my Wedge and I am using it sometimes and I use it to level/tamp at the same time when using it. Depth adjustment and the impact of it dropped down my consistency when using different type of beans/recipes so thats why I dont use it very often but it is one of the many cool gadgets you can buy and have fun with it.,i3txmgy,/r/espresso/comments/tykucz/lelit_mara_x_lets_make_a_cappuccino_workflow/i3vtxuq/'

i3tcn2h,2022-04-07 14:20:11,np8573,tyjnkx,My first ever espresso shot. Help!,My bad. Thought that was the drip tray grate.  If sour increase yield and/or grind finer. But try one thing at a time.

i3szt0x,2022-04-07 12:55:49,Salreus,tyjnkx,My first ever espresso shot. Help!,BTW going by the settings on the grinder is only valid IF the grinder starts at 0 when bottomed out. And this will depend on how its assembled. I dont care how my Q2 is assembled and currently bottomed out is at 6. so when I set my grinder for AP i need 1 1/2 turns which puts my dot at the 0 mark. So when you say you are at 1.4. the Jmax has 90 clicks per rotation and 10 clicks per number. So espresso starts at 1 full rotation (90 clicks) from bottomed out to 150 clicks. I suggest bottoming out your grinder and seeing where your zero mark is and do a full rotation and pull a shot and see where you are.,i3sxhpq,/r/espresso/comments/tyjnkx/my_first_ever_espresso_shot_help/i3szt0x/'

i3sss1q,2022-04-07 12:11:19,Carnasis,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,You can narrow down a bit here to help your decision making -  Functionally the Pro 700 and Synchronika are the exact same machine so just decide which you like the look of better (and price) then remove what you don‚Äôt pick from your list of options.  La Marzocco is pretty much hype from their commercial recognition which is absolutely valid but doesn‚Äôt translate into a better machine than these other options. As the other person mentioned it is a very simple machine that lacks features like a shot timer flow control and it‚Äôs a pain to adjust the machine. Everything is very cramped and it has a gigantic steam boiler for no reason. No machine on your list will have issues with back to back drinks so the overkill steam boiler is unnecessary. I‚Äôd argue that the LMLMs lack of features (that can only be added by annoying and expensive modifications) make it a worse machine. If it was better I would have bought one personally because I like the aesthetics the best.   The Lelit Bianca is good basically just a cheaper built Pro 700 / ECM Synchronika so if cost is a factor for you then this would be your option. It lacks in build quality vs the Profitec/ECM.

i3tajdc,2022-04-07 14:05:47,rbpx,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,Some great advice here I agree youd be fine with a Bianca Profitec or ECM.   Just thought Id say that you should also consider you grinder as we all know this has a big effect on quality of taste. I think you could step up to the DF64 (with mods) although I cant speak to the benefit vs cost. The much loved Niche has the conical burrs which give it the full body less clarity or high notes compared to the flat burrs in the Specialita or DF64 (which are described in comparison as lighter body more clarity or high notes). The Niche can be overly expensive depending on your location but its a favourite for a reason. However...  If youve got LMLM money then... pffffft... get the Synchonika and splurge on an Option-O Lagom P64 grinder.... oooh... its got flavour workflow beauty and even envy bonus points.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3tajdc/'
i3v17ta,2022-04-07 21:57:40,ruvanist,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,OP theres gonna be fanboys on both ECM/Profitec and Lelit camps. Im a Bianca owner btw.  I dont really understand the build quality argument. This is a chunk of metal thats gonna sit on your counter all day long and is essentially a high end hot water dispenser. Its not like youre gonna lug it around and have wear and tear.   So my advice is to decide on what features do you want. If there are retailers that have the machine on demo do go play with it.   Since the Bianca is the best value for money you can use the money saved to spend on accessories (e.g. force tamper or bravo tamper) that can improve your puck prep and workflow. The key to good espresso is puck prep. The machine just dispenses water.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3v17ta/'
i3vmcis,2022-04-08 02:12:34,Azure-92,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,Basically everything is said.   Bianca if it‚Äôs about bang for the buck I‚Äôd also give Lelit a little bonus for trying to update their products for the better. After recent changes we would have to see though.   Pro700/Synch. are basically similar as pointed out. I‚Äôd like the latter more though as it‚Äôs less boxy‚Ä¶ maybe personal preference. What they share is the weak link at the rotary pump the bypass valve. Easy fix though.   LM might be worst return for the money. It heats up quicker the adjustments with the app are very neat and the steaming is very different in a way that I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs easiest to steam well with. Beginners included. I‚Äôd also say by my own testing temp changes are done reasonably well much better than an E61 could. On the other hand if you can get a nicely cared for LM used it would be a no brainer as it would hold its value. Same with other machines‚Ä¶   VA Eagle One. Basically everything the LM can commercial steaming included plus energy consumption is less and added volumetric. It‚Äôs key for family or staff that aren‚Äôt that into it.  What sucks is the drip tray its too shallow meant to be plumbed in and there is a bit of flex on the group head‚Ä¶ not sure if that changed by now. The footprint is also bigger than what you might think as it‚Äôs rather wide. Not as cute as Hoffmann thinks  ‚Ä¶  Personal note: I‚Äôd never go with a machine that would compromise budget for a good grinder if I still need one. You‚Äôll get a much cleaner and softer/rounder/clearer shot out of an atom75 compared to a magnifico side by side.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3vmcis/'
i3srlft,2022-04-07 12:03:50,Worried_Document8668,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,The Synchronika and Pro 700 are the same machine internally made in the same place. Profitec is less Bling but same machine under the hood. Great machines beautiful layout inside and very service friendly. Easily upgraded with flow control.  The Bianca is an ergonomically superb machine that can handle it all. More simple build when it comes to metalwork and casing but some of the best value out there.  R58 also is a great machine and I really like the programming via display. Just not a fan of the wands and short driptray on it. Very solid build.  The LMLM is seriously bad value for money considering what you get in build and features and the huge steam boiler is overkill for anything apart from commercial applications or a family banquet.

I was planning on getting Synchronika initially but then I realized it was too big for my counter space. I wasnt even looking for flow control but boy its one of my favorite features of the machine now. So much more possibilities for a given coffee. I would definitely recommend getting a flow control on whatever machine you purchase if its an option. I would get a Decent but like you I worry about the long term viability.

i3u9gti,2022-04-07 18:13:16,Yakarue,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,Three months in to the Bianca v2 and we absolutely love it. Some things to consider.  * People mention build quality on the v2 and reference the welds of the drip tray specifically. This is true but also a non-issue because if it is it simply means you let the tray overfill and youre likely spilling out from the front as well. * If you arent plumbing your machine the movable water tank on the Bianca is amazing. Its one of the primary reasons we went with this machine. * Aside from the LMLM the Bianca is the best-looking for the buck. The other machines can looks excellent with wooden kit addons but those come at a hefty price. * One thing to mention about the LMLM is that it has the best steam performance of the four. So if you know what youre doing or are willing to practice to get there you can steam your milk extremely quickly (not that the other three are slouches). But you might be able to share 5-10 seconds off per steam session. * However the main reason youd get a LMLM is because you think it looks great want the exceptional build quality and known great service from LM. But as others mentioned it lacks a lot of features out of the box despite being the most expensive option by far.  Ultimately whatever you get you are going to be extremely happy.

i3usfus,2022-04-07 20:37:12,Eileithia,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,I‚Äôve had my Bianca for a couple months now and it‚Äôs a joy to use. Warm up time on all of these machines are about the same. Minor variations based on boiler size but I can pull a shot in about 15-20 from turning it on.  One great feature about the Bianca that I dont see mentioned is you can move the water tank. In my kitchen it ends up giving me easy access by putting the tank on the side of the machine instead pf the back. This lets me put it partially under the overhead cabinets without having to move the machine to fill it. The plastic inner tank is also very easy to remove clean etc. no issues with vibration noise and it‚Äôs quieter than I expected.   Coming from a Silvia it takes half the time to pull a perfect shot and the flow control makes those perfect shots happen basically every time.  Way less fucking about. It‚Äôs a real game changer.  Even if your grind is slightly off you can still rescue it.   The UI/UX of the control screen isnt great but it is pretty much set it once and forget it.   It also comes with IMS precision baskets bottomless PF and a backflush basket out of the box. The backflush basket gets stored under the drip tray. Some nice ‚Äúextras‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty sure are paid add-ons on your other choices.   10/10 would buy again.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3usfus/'

i3w1ex7,2022-04-08 05:04:07,Pwuebear,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,I have been looking at machines like the ones you listed and had similar considerations and concerns. Turning 40 this year and I wanted to spoil myself with some good equipment that I can use and care for the next few decades. If I had to list the ones I am looking into on a scale of reasonably affordable (here and now) to ultimate endgame (having to save more and for longer) more  it would be something like this:  There here and now selection which Id probably enjoy tremendously but would more than likely bother me that settled rather than went that mile extra:  Izzo Vivi PID Profitec Pro 500 PID or ECM Mechanika IV Profi  The mid- to high-end selection that would make me happy for years and years:  ECM Technika V Profi PID or Profitec Pro 700  The thing that bothers me the most about these classic E61 machines would be that it is mostly just a large box of shiny metal and while I can definitely see the appeal to me its quite boring. Its something I am going to use every day and I would like it to look beautiful not just make delicious coffee beverages. Most if not all of the have very clunky and ugly feet.  And the ultimate endgame. When weve reached the level of machines like the Linea Mini and onwards there are some key elements that I feel are lost behind the brand names and huge pricetags that follow. For the Linea Mini there are lots of things in the build quality that are just weird and displeasing to look at i.e. the temperature adjust wheel to the side feel cheap and flimsy and components inside are mounted and screwed together in weird places that makes the user-experience when modding or maintaining awkward. Also for the VA Eagle One Prima (that I will be listing as an endgame machine for me) has plastic handles to control steam and water at this price point I want to feel some craftsmanship. Regardless the list is as follows:  Faema Faemina Decent DE1+ or Victoria Arduino Eagle One Prima  Now Synesso has been teasing their Home edition machine for a long time now and it looks like they might unveil it in the next few days and I am very much looking forward to this. My go-to coffee bar uses their 3 group and its stunning. There is also the San Remo YOU coming to market soon if it isnt available already which also looks quite stunning. These are all over-top expensive and would require months/years before they Id be able to justify putting them in the kitchen though.

I have just returned from my most local machine dealer with a rather large box. Seeing them all [side by side ](https://imgur.com/a/7AQk6kr) really puts the sizes into perspective. I was definitely shocked at the size of a few of the machines and grinders in person.  Having a slightly restricted space ultimately made the decision the Profitec and ECM are not only a very square box theyre also a very large square box.  For the money it costs I went with the Lelit Bianca the quality concerns were quashed after comparing the V2 to the V3. Lelit have  improved on the fit and finish and this was evident seeing them both in person.  Who knows I may look to upgrade in the future but for now this has everything I wanted at the better price point.  Thank you all for your inputs and feedback this post is what I initially needed and I hope it can help someone else decide on their next machine.,i3sss1q,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3xp1fi/'

The question you should be asking is:   > what espresso machine features do I need?  If you can give us more info about how you plan to use your machine that would help. How many shots per day? How many shots in succession? Are you drinking straight shots or milk drinks? Do you like light roasts?  Your deciding between a Biance and a LMLM is troubling since these are such different types of machines. The Bianca has flow control to allow you to profile your shots. The LMLM is a minimalist machine with no profiling (unless you want to spend another $500 for an aftermarket kit to add it) but has amazing build quality. Which is more important to you?  Most troubling of all is that you never mention a grinder. The grinder is more important than the machine. Do you already have one? If so what is it?

i3syn6a,2022-04-07 12:48:36,Carnasis,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,I had some issues with my Bianca the main one that caused the return was there is a plastic wire connector that was too cramped up next to the boiler and it melted. It also had lots of vibrations from parts hitting each other or the metal paneling. That can happen with any machine but after swapping out to a Synch the difference in build quality is pretty distinct.   As far as your coffee goes they are identical to me. Which is why many would opt to spend less for the Bianca. But the overall build quality is on a different level and for a purchase this expensive I want to make sure I am getting the best I can get and if it means just going a little further then that‚Äôs what I did. I also liked the aesthetics of the Synch better the Bianca screen is hideous to me but the Synch does a good job of blending it in to keep it as classy as a digital screen like that can look.,i3su68z,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3syn6a/'

Over on Kiiji I still see someone trying to sell theirs for $1500.  So when it comes on a boat from China (as a Chinese product) I think were all on equal footing. But Euro and British products are really expensive here. The Aussies get a fantastic price on Breville products like the BDB (its almost twice the price here).  Yeah.

i3t4508,2022-04-07 13:23:15,JewishYoda,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,As a new Bianca owner that was leaning ECM until I was able to score a v2 for a deal I think the build quality concerns are a non-issue. The initial versions had issues with shipping due to the packaging but Ive heard this is fixed. Either way if something happens while shipped your retailer will take care of you.  From a reliability perspective the internals are totally comparable to an ECM. Youre still getting quality components/boilers that are overkill for a 2-4 shot/day user. If you are into light roasts I would go Bianca no question. Flow control is not a gimmick it is legit a game changer. I dont love the FC on the ECM/Profitec as you have to spin multiple revolutions for open/close. The upside is you get more control (the Bianca will have a smaller range) but I find the Bianca fully open to be plenty of flow and the paddle is a joy to use. With that said ECM takes the edge on build quality no question. Nothing compares to how neat it is under the hood and I personally think the black/chrome looks incredible.   Agreed that the LMLM is a terrible value temp is actually less accurate and no flow control sucks. Its also more expensive to maintain if it does need to be repaired. But cant argue with you on aesthetics its a gorgeous machine. Between ECM/Profitec/Bianca you will be happy with whatever you end up with. Deciding sucks but all are capable and very high quality. Lastly I would say dual boiler is not overkill. If you are even considering a LM you have the cash - you will regret anything less and end up buying a DB eventually anyway. Trust me.,i3stean,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3t4508/'
i3t3nvi,2022-04-07 13:20:11,Originalidad,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,For what it‚Äôs worth I just got my Bianca less than a week ago upgrading from a Breville duo temp pro. I do 1-4 shots a day maybe 2 milk drinks between my wife and I and I was in an extremely similar position to yours in which I had enough for the Bianca but I really could have went for something much more expensive.   I saw you‚Äôre upgrading from a gaggia Yes I‚Äôm sure the Bianca isn‚Äôt as robust as the LMLM in terms of build quality but is it worth an extra $4000? Honestly the Bianca feels eons better than my duo temp pro in durability/quality I think that when it arrives you will feel similarly. I still think the LMLM is a much more beautiful machine with the Matte white and walnut accents but the Bianca is great in its feature set I love light roasts the flow profiling is mind blowing and it is still very aesthetically pleasing imo. I was in your exact same spot and I‚Äôm extremely happy with the Bianca knowing I spent within my budget and still got a machine that will last a looooong time with proper care. My one complaint is I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the knob style for steam and Lelit as a company has significant play on their knobs meaning you have to turn them a bit before they start producing steam/water I confirmed that this is a conscious design choice made by Lelit with customer service its not my favorite but it‚Äôs also not that big of a deal :p good luck deciding!,i3stean,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3t3nvi/'
i3sunfm,2022-04-07 12:23:10,Worried_Document8668,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,From my experience in our Workshop Bianca tend to be bought by lots of people rather new to the world Of espressomachines because of the great value. These beginners often dont take good care and a lot of Biancas come in with user made problems. Component wise(apart from the case) they dont really have more issues than most other manufacturers.  The LMLM isnt even a great value at 1k under retail when it comes to whats inside. Unless you actually use so much steam that you really need the 35l steam boiler theres barely a reason to go for a Linea instead of one of the others + grinder upgrade,i3stean,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3sunfm/'

i3xmgdn,2022-04-08 11:26:45,martijnonreddit,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,Personally as a E61 HX owner I don‚Äôt see why HX would be a compromise. My machine can easily do four cappuccinos in a row and I‚Äôve never run out of steam power. The only downside is pouring hot water will sometimes trigger a boiler refill. But then the PID shows you the brew temperature so you know when it‚Äôs ready again (about 15 seconds I think).  I don‚Äôt want to add additional complication to your choice but I feel like HX is a great design especially for an E61 (because group head thermodynamics).  Anyway out of this list I‚Äôd go with the ECM because quality and the steam/water valve joysticks are the best.

i3tenze,2022-04-07 14:34:00,DG17-Dragon,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,For me personally the LMLM would be put aside. Nice machine but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Ive worked quite a few time with the Rocket Cinquantotto. And that is a lovely machine! Considering its even cheaper than the ECM Synchonika and almost the same as the Profitec could be considered.  Also the Bezzera Duo is nice but this one is almost completely digital. So that might be a problem?  Edit:  Wanted to add something about FlowControl. I feel like this feature is nice and all but considering that you have to repeat the same profile over and over again. Manually. Is a big downside. Since it is hard to recreate the last espresso youve made.   A machine with pressure profile would be a interesting. Something like the Crem One 4 for example.,i3tdkbu,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3tenze/'
i3ubm0i,2022-04-07 18:28:44,rbpx,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,>PID is essential and shot timers would be a perk.  Yeah most people think the PID is all about temperature stability but I argue that its actually a bigger benefit of the PID that it lets you ***select*** the temperature (with a digital UX). Before the PID machines had pressurestats which were most often difficult or inconvenient to access and didnt give a digital readout of temperature.  In 2022 there is absolutely no reason to buy a new machine that doesnt sport a PID.  That said some people sound like theyre indifferent to having the shot timer. Personally I absolutely must have this (now that I do) because I always found the scale or phone to be an awkward part of the workflow (either the scale capacitive buttons didnt read my finger press or my hand was wet and I didnt like touching my phone). PIDs today integrate a shot timer in them.,i3tdkbu,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3ubm0i/'

i3t95iz,2022-04-07 13:56:25,JewishYoda,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,Tip I got from 1st Line: Dont screw the knobs all the way to the right to close. Close just enough to cut off water. It will a) make sure theres no wear and tear and b) will make it MUCH easier to open the valve when you need steam or hot water. I literally just do a quarter turn and I get steam quarter turn off and its closed. The joysticks were a big selling point of the ECM for me and I was worried Id have buyers remorse because of that but dont feel that way at all anymore. Also for steaming 2 oz of milk for a cortado its nice to not open the steam wand all the way and get a bit less power.,i3t3nvi,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3t95iz/'

Its all about the name/status of the machine not the functionality. Commercial equipment is more durable but even if one want to go that route there are plenty of commercial machines that are much cheaper and built with the same components.

i3sqy7b,2022-04-07 11:59:49,MyCatsNameIsBernie,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,If it were me Id go for the Bianca. On an E61 machine like the Bianca I think flow control is essential for light roasts so you can use extended pre-infusions and low brew pressures to maximize extraction.   Your Specialita will be a good match for the Bianca but if the money that would have been spent on the LMLM is burning a hole in your wallet then get one of the end-game grinders in the $3K price range.,i3sq39s,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3sqy7b/'
i3uil69,2022-04-07 19:19:29,PrimarySwan,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,Kaffeemacher a Swiss group of roasters and shop owners did extensive testing of the LMLM and found a significant temperature drop pulling back to back shots. They pull 5 shots in 5 minutes. Same protocol as they did on their in depth HX analysis of 14 machines. There where HXs that performed better than the LM. Its a thermoblock same tech as a Bambino or Barista Pro. Its perfectly adequate for home use but they do this test because some people like to host a wedding or a party and many dual boilers are perfectly capable of that. LMLM not. Unless youre doing Chai Lattes mostly. So not getting a dual boiler when you are in the price range of some of the best DBs (at way less than the Linnea) would be a mistake in my oppinion.   Take all that with a grain of salt since Im a single boiler degenerate but I like keeping up with machines I might buy someday (Bianca/Synchronika/Classika). But I think any of three other will be excellent value and perform similarily. Id pick Synchronika but aim an ECM fan. I think they do ask a lot of money for their machines but back that up with excellent products.,i3sq39s,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3uil69/'

Lelit is owned by Breville and the build quality is just not up to par for the price point.  If profiling or flow control is a feature you want to maximize you light roast you can get the Profitec or ECM with flow control or as an add on for $200 USD.  The LMLM is pretty but it is over priced for what it is basically buying the name.  Of the four choices Profitec and ECM offer the best build quality and they are owned by the same company. The main difference in those two models is knob vs lever for stream and hot water. That is the decision point in my opinion.,i3sq39s,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i3tgou9/'
i3xplol,2022-04-08 11:47:00,dbcooper4,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,With an HX machine you (the barista) have to constantly be compensating for the temp swings shot-to-shot.

i46td2m,2022-04-10 10:42:26,Carnasis,tyjg73,I need help! Machine Comparison.,The Bianca has about 1/4 of the available adjustment range of the Profitec/ECM flow control. Because the paddle doesn‚Äôt go a full 360. So I found scenarios on the Bianca where I want to slowly infuse starting at 4g/s and work my way up to 12g/s and that 8g/s range is about all you can do. But for darker roasts or older beans I want to hit it with a higher flow rate from the beginning and work my way backwards down to almost closed. You just can‚Äôt do that with a Bianca. You can get close but again that will require adjusting the paddle position if you‚Äôve been doing medium or lighter roasts. It‚Äôs frustrating because if you have flow control and know how to use it and want to get the most out of it it really sucks to have that limitation. Albeit the paddle looks cooler than the ECM/Profitec one.  As a side note: Since adjustable range on the Profitec/ECM goes from 0g/s all the way up to like 28-30 you can even do drip style coffee with the machine by grinding coarse and then cranking up the flow rate high. I do this for people who don‚Äôt like espresso and just want some smooth black drip coffee.,i44vs3s,/r/espresso/comments/tyjg73/i_need_help_machine_comparison/i46td2m/'

But Ill also make this suggestion: instead of getting a grinder get better quality pre-ground coffee.  Yeah pre-ground isnt as good as freshly ground.  But I can guarantee you that any grinder you buy under $1000 simply wont hold up in an office environment.  Some idiot will ruin the burrs by grinding too finely someone else will spill grinds all over the place... Itll be a complete CF.  So get your local roaster to grind the beans run it through a nice drip machine. Youll have better coffee than 90% of offices out there and youll have saved yourself some major heartache.,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyi0ga/espresso_machine_for_small_office/i3unkz1/'

i3siqoz,2022-04-07 11:09:17,Rashkh,tyi0ga,Espresso Machine for Small Office,$500 will get you an entry level superautomatic from Gaggia or Philips but those machines are designed for home use. If youre making a lot of drinks then youre going to be refilling the water and beans constantly. If youre using it well over the rated duty cycle then would expect the machines life spanned to be shortened  as well. For a drip grinder the cheapest option Id recommend is a Baratza Encore. You can get them refurbished from Baratza for about $120.

i3t678i,2022-04-07 13:36:35,filthysven,tyi0ga,Espresso Machine for Small Office,A group of 20 people using a machine (or even ten like they said) will burn through that machine in no time. And nobody in their right mind thinks that an office full of people want to hand grind their coffee step outside the espresso echo chamber and you will find that not even most home users want that let alone busy people trying to get a quick caffeine hit at their office. Your suggestions are great for a budget home setup but horribly misguided for that kind of environment. You vastly overestimate the ability and willingness of a group of non hobbyists to use and maintain manual machines. Even with a small office a hand grinder and semi auto is never going to work will not remain clean or dialed in and will be nonfunctional in a matter of months if more than one person even bothers to try using it which they probably wont at that point. People in most offices Ive been too can barely be assed to empty the grounds and make a new pot in a drip machine which breaks constantly due to neglect and lack of maintenance. There is zero chance this would work anywhere but a startup with 3 employees that are already into espresso of their own accord and even then its questionable.,i3t4lk6,/r/espresso/comments/tyi0ga/espresso_machine_for_small_office/i3t678i/'
i3slj0s,2022-04-07 11:26:25,Rashkh,tyi0ga,Espresso Machine for Small Office,Honestly either go for a Nespresso system or save up for something designed for office use like the Jura WE6 if you want espresso style drinks.

i3sgr8o,2022-04-07 10:56:48,slickmamba,tyhhhx,Need help dialing in - results not consistent,20g of a darker roast is alot in the stock 54mm basket. You are likely hitting the shower head and potentially getting channeling. Try dropping it to 18g or even 17 and grinding finer.   Also the spinny distributors do an awful job of distributing they only flatten the top really. If you can return the crema tool I would highly suggest it.

i3sljql,2022-04-07 11:26:33,MyCatsNameIsBernie,tyhhhx,Need help dialing in - results not consistent,How are you tamping? For consistent results you need a firm and consistent tamp that fully compresses the puck. If you are using your Crema tamper its depth may not be set long enough to fully compress the puck. Either set it as deep as possible or use the stock Breville tamper.  I agree with the other comments that you should reduce your yield to 17-18g. and grind finer.   My understanding of the Barista Pros grinder is that it is stepless so you should be able to set the grind between numbers if thats what you need. I dont have a BBP so please correct me if I am wrong.

[How To Dial In Espresso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrQfn4jcWS8) has some great advice.  Too Sour most often comes from poor extraction caused by too little time with the water caused by channeling and poor puck prep (though it can also be caused by too low a water temperature).  Is it possible to increase the temperature or decrease the pressure ? (not all machines allow this). Of course grinding finer can also help but it could also be counter-productive if its forcing channeling...,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyh4if/what_to_do_if_a_shot_is_12_in_30_seconds_but_is/i3s9hi0/'

I‚Äôm looking at the manual and I can change the pre-infusion. The default is gentle where small defined amounts of water are introduced gently adding moisture to bloom the grinds in preparation for a steady water flow for a balanced taste. There are two more options.    A single distinct dose of water followed by a brief rest then a steady water flow for a more bright taste.   And finally a constant steady water flow from start to finish for a more sharp taste.  My palate is not refined enough to know all of these profiles. I wish I could put a name to the flavor I‚Äôm looking for. Robust?  Full?  Rich?

From here you need to experiment with different yields and grind settings and see what tastes best. I follow the Barista Hustle method of keeping the dose constant finding the yield that tastes best and finally finding the grind setting that tastes best. You can also try varying the temperature and pre-infusion time if your machine allows it.,i3sj9of,/r/espresso/comments/tyh4if/what_to_do_if_a_shot_is_12_in_30_seconds_but_is/i3sjqg5/'
i3v55va,2022-04-07 22:38:18,rbpx,tyh4if,What to do if a shot is 1:2 in 30 seconds but is still sour?,Try a puck screen. Even try adding a paper filter on the bottom.  Try dosing into portafilter directly. DONT tap to settle grinds. DONT WDT deeply just rake the mountain top over to cover the surface evenly with as little interaction as possible.  While GOOD wdt equipment and technique can help BAD equipment/technique WILL CAUSE channeling. So try an experiment where you remove WDT to see if there is any change.  The idea here is to try to remove channeling from (possibly) being involved.  My guess is your machine uses a lot of pressure (I have no idea why they do this) and it becomes a real challenge to prevent channeling.,i3us20n,/r/espresso/comments/tyh4if/what_to_do_if_a_shot_is_12_in_30_seconds_but_is/i3v55va/'

My roommate got me into speciality coffee and we are looking to upgrade from our silvia pid.,I feel like in some ways Im able to make better espresso with my Decent because the profile is precise every time. Confounders from shot to shot are kept to a minimum because all I really have to do is dial in the beans and make sure my prep is consistent. The machine takes out the human error.  I dont have to time or watch a scale (it turns off automatically by weight). I dont have to manually change/time the flow. I dont have to manually control/time the preinfusion. I dont have to manually change the pressure during the shot. I just press start and forget about it while I go prep other things. Itll turn off when it reaches the weight I want (or it can auto shut off by time or by flow or shut off manually). But! I also can change all those presets if I want to. (Theres a menu of default presets to choose from if you prefer.)

i3s0qrk,2022-04-07 09:12:04,DrGoose22,tyf0hc,First shot with my first ever coffee machine (after calibration Lelit Anna 2),Thats a great start! Id say it looks a little slow for a standard 2:1 double so you could coarsen your grind a little. Also would strongly recommend making sure youre weighing your input grounds and output liquid so you know youre hitting the ratio you want. This flow and where you stopped the shot looks more like a ristretro (1:1.5 or so) but hard to know for sure without in and out weights. Happy brewing!,-,/r/espresso/comments/tyf0hc/first_shot_with_my_first_ever_coffee_machine/i3s0qrk/'
i3tvdr9,2022-04-07 16:30:28,Expert-Sample-7823,tyf0hc,First shot with my first ever coffee machine (after calibration Lelit Anna 2),Seems like you have more extraction on the left side of your puck than the right because you get more dripping on the left side. This might explain the ‚Äústrong‚Äù taste you mentioned in another comment but really depends on the coffee beans ofcourse.  This is probably the result of uneven distribution. I used to have this in the beginning but solved it with a WDT and distributor.  If you don‚Äôt have any of the two a light tap on the counter to let the ground coffee distribute itself evenly will go a long way.

My previous grinder (sette 270wi) was starting to flake and need repairs by this point whereas the specialita still operated like it did on day 1. I use a single dose hopper with bellows so retention is quite low.  My only gripe with Specialita is that the usability is not great it takes some time to get used to the small dial knob and doesnt have a weight based dosing (unlike sette 270wi) but that aside once youve had the machine for couple weeks youll get used to it.

Also the specialita is a time tested extremely popular machine you can expect it to last decades and have easy parts availability if ever needed. All that said its only $700 in the US.

In comparison with a normal basket you get like 46% more hole area. Im curious what shots with that would taste like when you get to grind finer.  Im surprised they didnt lead with the area comparison in the product description... The acid issue/cleaning of the portafilter and basket is a very trivial problem to be solving.

I dont doubt the pucks would be looser than an appropriately sized shot but possibly manageable. Id have to see it in action.  Im interested to see if having a larger diameter of holes at the bottom of the basket/filter makes much of a difference and what (if any) impact there is from having straight walls.  I completely agree that this product is massively flawed in conception supremely overpriced and solves a problem that almost nobody has. But I think there is some merit in the idea and if so Id be interested in seeing if other companies iterate on the design further.,i40kodr,/r/espresso/comments/tyeqo4/weber_workshops_blocked_me_on_instagram_for/i42jnnv/'

The exchange took place after doing a lot of reading in forums- not just bad things but good things because I had a pre-order in. Ultimately I decided to cancel the order because of the customer service issues. The grinder itself was/is likely to be great but people were reporting issues and the cs response was its your fault or its the burrs fault. PS here- the burrs take a long time to break in which is fine if youre aware of it but theyre under-reporting and thus dealing with complaints that could be avoided.  Move forward to my refund request. The response was (paraphrased) were so confident youll love it well let you return it (at my not insignificant shipping expense) if you dont love it. K but thats not what I asked for. So I asked again and got anothe bs answer asked again and got the owner making the same offer. Ffs. I brought up the issue of a potential problem being blamed on me and he ignored the question. He also ignored my comment about telling people the burrs need more seasoning that theyre admitting. So it took several days but I got the refund and good riddance. What really sucks is there are no immediate alternatives- all the grinders in this class are months away from delivering. I ended up bumping my budget up even higher to get a Ditting. Supposed to be arriving very soon.,i3s8ip7,/r/espresso/comments/tyeqo4/weber_workshops_blocked_me_on_instagram_for/i3spc1d/'

Like their products are obviously superior to the DF64 or Eureka grinders and its no competition.   But compared to Kafatek and Option-O theres many questionable decisions. Like the driveshaft for the burrs are always long and never straight theres a reason the aforementioned manufacturers dont have 6 inch burr shafts.  Theyre also always very quick to blame everyone but themselves. its shippings fault when they designed the box its shipped in. Its the burrs fault when they claim its pre-seasoned and theyre the ones that picked the burrs. Kafatek was so picky about burrs they designed their own and then night all their own machinery because the machinists wouldnt meet their standards Kafatek also doesnt use crowdfunding their grinders are made stateside they use standard replaceable motors.,i3vbns7,/r/espresso/comments/tyeqo4/weber_workshops_blocked_me_on_instagram_for/i3vcyla/'

Normally crowdfunded campaigns disable refunds as soon as the campaign is over and tooling is kicked off. This is what enables crowdfunding to work and why everyone was able to buy a KEY at up to $500 the normal retail price. It is not normal eCommerce shopping. We extended this much longer than normal went far beyond our refund budget and as of last week have placed a hard stop on refunds.

I can look up the exact date if you need it but if I had to guess Id say they got quite a few refund requests and since mine was fairly early in the whole Sprometheus thing they mayve changed their tune about refunds since then.

So against my better judgement I allowed myself to start getting a little excited about it. Well Thursday night now and still no tracking no response to my email yesterday asking whats going on. Like I or they just dont exist anymore. Will Majesty turn out to be in the same class as Weber?,i3ugokb,/r/espresso/comments/tyeqo4/weber_workshops_blocked_me_on_instagram_for/i3ur99t/'

i3tg27j,2022-04-07 14:43:32,Lighting,tyeqo4,Weber Workshops blocked me on Instagram for pointing out citric acid is used as a finisher on stainless steel and is not actively bad,Well whats recommended by users and manufacturers is interesting but ultimately what determines facts are the scientific experiments/evidence.  Lead used to be recommended as a wine sweetener. Im finding interesting test results like   > [Journal of Agric Food Chem. 2013 Oct 2.  This study examined stainless steel grades cooking time repetitive cooking cycles and multiple types of tomato sauces for their effects on nickel and chromium leaching. ... After six hours of cooking Ni and Cr concentrations in tomato sauce increased up to 26- and 7-fold respectively depending on the grade of stainless steel. Longer cooking durations resulted in additional increases in metal leaching where Ni concentrations increased 34 fold and Cr increased approximately 35 fold from sauces cooked without stainless steel. Cooking with new stainless steel resulted in the largest increases.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4284091/)  The pH for canned tomatoes is in [the range of 3.5-4.7](https://techiescientist.com/ph-of-tomato/) while Citric acid has a [pH level between 3 and 6](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/citric-acid/). So tomatoes are **more** acidic and experiments showed they leach chromium from food-grade stainless steel.  Edit: Interestingly espresso is not as acidic as tomatoes or coffee: [at a pH of 5.5 to 6](https://freshcoffeehouse.com/espresso-less-acidic-than-coffee/),i3tcxtk,/r/espresso/comments/tyeqo4/weber_workshops_blocked_me_on_instagram_for/i3tg27j/'

Thanks!  According to the study  >the removal of iron and other exogenous materials from the surface.... The chromium present in the alloy and also the nickel in the austenitic 300 grades are then able to form an oxide layer that protects the underlying steel from normal environmental conditions  and  according to Table 2 Metal Content Of Citric Acid Bath After 30 Days Passivation Of 316L SS  what gives the metallic taste was the iron (Fe) being drawn out of the stainless steel.   and   > With only the iron being removedcitric acid passivated parts have a thicker later of chromium on the surface thus allowing a better chrome oxide layer to form   which makes it clear that stainless steel when exposed to these acids brings the chromium to the surface of the material  Also interesting was this comment  > as any alteration of the surface will expose new free iron.  which they go on to say means that if you scratch your stainless steel cookware then exposing it to more of an acidic environment will again start that leeching process.

i3vunf3,2022-04-08 03:56:33,Lighting,tyeqo4,Weber Workshops blocked me on Instagram for pointing out citric acid is used as a finisher on stainless steel and is not actively bad,>  Idk if you‚Äôre gonna be soaking your equipment in a similar concentration (because obviously pH isn‚Äôt the only factor when considering the corrosiveness of a solution) for 20 hours or cooking tomato sauce for 20 hours but the study says that between 2-6 hours of cook time leacHing wasn‚Äôt an issue.  The study was done over 20 hours not because they expected someone to cook tomatoes for that long but to measure changes over time. Since this was a leaching experiment theres no difference between cooking tomatoes for 20 hours or cooking 20 times for one hour each. If you assume that you are making tomato sauce weekly youd hit that in just a few months of cooking.   Since tomato sauce is slightly more acidic than citric acid one would expect to measure similar leaching in both liquids.   > But in an appropriate concentration citric acid is ok for and widely used for cleaning steel.  Based on what? They used to say the same thing about adding lead to wine for making it taste sweet. It was commonly done too.

Any finer on the grinder and the Gaggia chokes and doesn‚Äôt pull a shot.  You arent going to be able to do much better than that.  You need a better grinder.

The burrs are very wobbly and inconsistent maybe the lower bearings help.

i3t52pd,2022-04-07 13:29:17,slickmamba,tycyrv,Is anyone using a Skerton to grind for espresso?,It depends if the pressure is too high you lower the dose too low increase the dose.

The Bambino ($299) and Crono ($209) combo gets you a better machine and grinder than the Barista Express for less money and adding a Baratza Encore grinder ($169) takes them a bit over budget but gets them a very solid grinder for regular drip/french press/pour over/cold brew coffee so they dont have go through the hassle of switching the grinder from espresso to drip and back which is often a poor experience.

But if I was only doing espresso or maybe doing a vast majority espresso I‚Äôd probably consider the J-Max. Finer adjustments and faster grind times for what seem to be very similar cups.  In any circumstance the C40 is fantastic. I don‚Äôt lust after a Niche because I‚Äôm very happy with it. Could be faster but I don‚Äôt mind.

Since I‚Äôm using it with my pump machine and can‚Äôt manipulate pressure I‚Äôve even wished they had a finer click system than the 15 microns.   I ended up modding my Comandante to be stepless. You could try to do that and hold off on red clix but having both gives you perfect control. To go stepless all you have to do is put a little plastic washer between the burr and dial piece.

(need some advice),I use the razor from time to time only after I tamp to make sure the puck will clear the shower screen.  How much coffee will fit in the basket depends on the coffee. Darker roasts are less dense and will take up more volume than a dose of lighter roast at the same weight. IIRC Breville recommends 16-19g for the 2-cup basket. Also finer ground coffee takes up less space than coarser ground.  What grinder do you have?

i3qrtyn,2022-04-07 02:55:28,BenjoleZ,ty9h9r,Sneakpeak: DIY(ish) Single Dose 85mm Flatburr Grinder,Im building a single dose grinder with the guts of a Gaggia MD85 commercial grinder and finished the first (3d printed final will be all milled aluminium) prototype of the panel/top-end today. Thought its finally far enough to give yall a little sneakpeak and get some suggestions. Obviously its still got some mayor kinks to work out and not all parts are redesigned yet.  Also some panels are missing and im still missing ideas on how to do the chute...any ideas?  Features im rather proud of while wondering why noone has done them yet  \- Vernier scale for grind setting on the burrcarrier itself so very repeatable  \- kept the wormgear-adjustment of the Gaggia but made it springloaded -> makes cleaning and switching to filter size much quicker as to not having to spin that worm a million times  Things on my todo list/issues i working on:  \- the knob...its ugly af  \- the scale has to be at the same height as the vernier scale hard to read otherwise  \- lower front panel chute design has to be finished first though  &#x200B  (Edit: Todos),-,/r/espresso/comments/ty9h9r/sneakpeak_diyish_single_dose_85mm_flatburr_grinder/i3qrtyn/'

i3rz3ga,2022-04-07 09:00:12,raven737,ty9h9r,Sneakpeak: DIY(ish) Single Dose 85mm Flatburr Grinder,Im just converting a Rancilio MD80 (75mm) to single dose usage.     I printed a bean funnel to match the size of of my DF64 so that I can use the same bellows. I guess not everyone like to use bellows but something to consider in the design in case you want it.  I would also recommend eliminating or keeping as short as possible the ground chute. By eliminate i mean put a large round funnel to catch and gently guide the grinds sort of like what the Super Jolly does? (I dont have one)  I like the Rancilio adjustment style a secondary dial with a small gear in the bottom that engages the outside gear at the top. The smaller dial also has numbers its even better than the vernier scale as you have the gearing.

i3szi2d,2022-04-07 12:53:58,EmergencyCredit,ty9h9r,Sneakpeak: DIY(ish) Single Dose 85mm Flatburr Grinder,Wrote this to someone else maybe helps:  The vernier scale is the thing happening at the top with the 0-10. The spacings in the 0-10 are slightly smaller than the spacings in the rest of the wheel. In this case they are 0.9* the radial angle of the space in the wheel as you can see that it goes from 33 to 42 in the [photo](https://preview.redd.it/1u5qu03tv2s81.jpg?width=3148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30c2918a428222605754a386dc185910477649d3) which is simply 0.9 on the wheels scale.   This allows you to use this clever system of measurement discovered by a mathematician named Vernier where you measure the setting to a greater accuracy by first looking at which whole number on the wheel matches with the 0 on the top scale in the [photos case](https://preview.redd.it/1u5qu03tv2s81.jpg?width=3148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30c2918a428222605754a386dc185910477649d3) 33 and then find the fraction remaining by looking at which of the lines lines up best with the lines on the wheel. In this case its 3 or 4 (parallax issue of camera angle so cant say so easily) lets say 3 so we know its 33.3. This is because when the 0 is perfectly aligned lets say it was perfectly sat on 33 then the 1 sits 0.9 away from that or 33.9 and the 2 0.9 away from that or 34.8 and the 3 0.9 away from that or 35.7. Therefore for the 3 to line up perfectly we had to have moved from 33 to 33.3 and therefore the 3 lines matching part from 35.7 to 36 (where there is a line on the wheel and therefore a match!)  This is a little confusing as a concept but I think its really cool how it works!,i3qrsiv,/r/espresso/comments/ty9h9r/sneakpeak_diyish_single_dose_85mm_flatburr_grinder/i3szi2d/'

i3s196e,2022-04-07 09:15:30,BenjoleZ,ty9h9r,Sneakpeak: DIY(ish) Single Dose 85mm Flatburr Grinder,Nice how are you dealing with the grounds-bin?  I tried a bellow but didnt really enjoy it as it was rather low quality (could find a good one that wasnt exorbitantly priced for what it is). But i probably wont need a bellow on this so far the retention inside the chamber is minimal/near zero (as long as i ignore the copious amounts of static retention). Only issue is the chute which the grinds absoloutely love to stick to.  I believe Ill chop of the original grind-chute and put a short vertical one in its place. Probably split in half with the front half mounted via magnets so i can easily take it off...im not final on the design and its mounting yet though. The funnel thing would be nice but it would need to be small to not look wierd. And i couldnt find one and dont have the tools to make it that way either :(  The Gaggia had something quite similar a second gear with a dial on it - though that was a bit different. While probably more precise didnt retain its absoloute position when cleaning (unless you took good care of not moving it). And also the way it worked wouldnt have played nice with the spring loaded wormdrive i wanted.

i3xup9k,2022-04-08 12:20:36,BenjoleZ,ty9h9r,Sneakpeak: DIY(ish) Single Dose 85mm Flatburr Grinder,Well thats rather tough to answer honestly. Im coming from an Amfim Best which is an awesome grinder in its own right. The new one is certainly better/nicer to use (one would hope so after all Im making it just the way I like it) and a whole lot faster at grinding. Those were the main points for me. As for the taste Im gonna be honest and say that I dont see a massive difference - but that may just be me not picking up on it all. Dont get me wrong it does taste better a little cleaner (or crisper if that makes sense?)... But who knows if thats just me being excited about it. There is however a noticeable difference in fluffiness of the grinds and do appear to be very uniform.,i3v3k8r,/r/espresso/comments/ty9h9r/sneakpeak_diyish_single_dose_85mm_flatburr_grinder/i3xup9k/'

Few things to be said about it:   It lifts the entire driptray so the final measurement includes the discharge from the grouphead...but at that point the espresso is done so who cares (also it can warn you when the driptray gets full who needs those pesky red floaty-bits on modern machines right?)  Its a single loadcell with fixed support on the backside which means the scale is severely influenced by the placement of the cup (forward/backward). I put a crosshair unter the grid which shines trough just enough to make cup placment easy. It was only supposed to be a temporary solution until two more loadcells arrived but it worked so well i never bothered to change it.    And finally: Yes putting the PCB straight under the Grouphead-Discharge was a big brainfart on my part as it sometimes drips onto it while cleaning the tray...but ohh well it still works :D,i3qzxkp,/r/espresso/comments/ty9h9r/sneakpeak_diyish_single_dose_85mm_flatburr_grinder/i3r0yfu/'

i3szfed,2022-04-07 12:53:29,EmergencyCredit,ty9h9r,Sneakpeak: DIY(ish) Single Dose 85mm Flatburr Grinder,Thats just a screw adjustment. The vernier scale is the thing happening at the top with the 0-10. The spacings in the 0-10 are slightly smaller than the spacings in the rest of the wheel. In this case they are 0.9* the radial angle of the space in the wheel as you can see that it goes from 33 to 42 in the [photo](https://preview.redd.it/1u5qu03tv2s81.jpg?width=3148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30c2918a428222605754a386dc185910477649d3) which is simply 0.9 on the wheels scale.   This allows you to use this clever system of measurement discovered by a mathematician named Vernier where you measure the setting to a greater accuracy by first looking at which whole number on the wheel matches with the 0 on the top scale in the [photos case](https://preview.redd.it/1u5qu03tv2s81.jpg?width=3148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30c2918a428222605754a386dc185910477649d3) 33 and then find the fraction remaining by looking at which of the lines lines up best with the lines on the wheel. In this case its 3 or 4 (parallax issue of camera angle so cant say so easily) lets say 3 so we know its 33.3. This is because when the 0 is perfectly aligned lets say it was perfectly sat on 33 then the 1 sits 0.9 away from that or 33.9 and the 2 0.9 away from that or 34.8 and the 3 0.9 away from that or 35.7. Therefore for the 3 to line up perfectly we had to have moved from 33 to 33.3 and therefore the 3 lines matching part from 35.7 to 36 (where there is a line on the wheel and therefore a match!)  This is a little confusing as a concept but I think its really cool how it works!,i3s6io2,/r/espresso/comments/ty9h9r/sneakpeak_diyish_single_dose_85mm_flatburr_grinder/i3szfed/'
i4lm4zb,2022-04-13 11:44:20,BenjoleZ,ty9h9r,Sneakpeak: DIY(ish) Single Dose 85mm Flatburr Grinder,Im currently building a website documenting the entire build (though I have to be honest its probably gonna be a while till its ready :D) The biggest pointer would be to get a grinder (the Gaggia  MD85/MG and MD64 are great for this) where motor and grind chamber are one unit or at least not integrated into the housing. That way you can take that out easily build a basic enclosure and dont have to fuss around building any of the high accuracy/ high force stuff. But I guess if youre hunting for a gaggia thats already taken care of. Apart from that: Plan the build sturdy. Like REALLY FREAKING sturdy. The motor plus chamber weighs like 13KG and is suspended by 4 screws. And it vibrates. Bad combo. Also if I would do it again I would try hard to get some kind of vibration isolation put in I skipped that due to it being rather difficult due to weight and so on...but man that thing shakes the whole building.

I\`d recommend you use three just two will either not solve the placement dependency (if you put in a third support) or result in a wobbly mess (tried it). That driptray is quite a lot of weight to balance on two cells and the sloshing water makes stuff even worse.   The mountings are essentially just little ramps to make loading easier and have helt up perfectly for about a year now.

It only rained about 3 hours later. So despite it may be because of humidity its just frustrating.   The strange thing was prior to the first day Ive actually spent around 3 days dialing in (1 espresso per day) to the best grind setting and just 1 day after getting my best grind setting and my best flow things completely change and now Im not sure I should stick with the previous grind settings or go through the dialing process again. I can deal with dialing in by small increments or decreases on the grind setting everyday I have been keeping track after everyday after all. Its just that the beans behaved totally differently and so suddenly its like why do I even bother?.

i3slg8k,2022-04-07 11:25:57,kevuin,ty81q0,Calibration problems with Sage/Breville The Oracle,I own the Oracle Touch and have had similar experiences. Grind consistency of the Oracle series is not optimal and others have talked about this before too. But there are ways to deal with it to some extent.  There are four possible explanations:  1. **Retention of grounds**:  While dialling in the shot your optimal shot wasnt made up exclusively of coffee grounds of the last grind setting but from a previous setting too. This is due to the retention of grounds from burrs chute and tamping mechanism. This can be partially overcome by dialling in the new grind setting and grinding a few grams to be disposed.  2. **Tamping mechanism**: There is also the possibility that the tamping mechanism isnt consistent and does not distribute/tamp the coffee grounds identically every time.  3. **Grinder Temperature after consecutive shots**: The size of the burrs and other components change after they are heated up by multiple rounds of grinding coffee. This change in size of components changes the effective grind size changing the outcome of your shot.  4. **Grinder Build Quality**: The simplest claim is that the grinders build quality is just bad and therefore inconsistent.  I personally believe that 1. and 3. make up most of what you are seeing. Ive definitely experienced a strong change of outcome after grinding a lot of coffee.  I try to avoid grinding large amounts in one sitting and purge grounds when changing grind size. I do however believe that 4. also plays a significant role.,-,/r/espresso/comments/ty81q0/calibration_problems_with_sagebreville_the_oracle/i3slg8k/'
i3uz6le,2022-04-07 21:37:42,SandmanNet,ty81q0,Calibration problems with Sage/Breville The Oracle,Thank you for your response. So just to comment on your possible explanation.  1 is unlikely since when dialling in the shot I always grind a couple of mg before testing the grind to make sure I dont get a blend like you say.  2 is possible and I can only judge the puck hardness and dampness from time to time and it seems very consistent to me. And with automatic tamping it should really mean its similar at least. Im comparing it to manual tamping on the Barista Express so...  3 is a likely candidate but would it really make a 30s 60ml shot into a 30s 20ml shot?  4 seems unlikely given that the grinder in The Oracle shouldnt be worse than the one in The Barista Express at least where consistent espresso is easily attained. Right?  But as far as 3 goes The Oracle does have a fan for the grinder/hopper so maybe I should go into advanced settings and turn that up...,i3slg8k,/r/espresso/comments/ty81q0/calibration_problems_with_sagebreville_the_oracle/i3uz6le/'
i40t88s,2022-04-09 04:27:00,kevuin,ty81q0,Calibration problems with Sage/Breville The Oracle,I guess one could argue that 1 is not completely avoidable due to the sheer amount of retention. So this purging behavior can only compensate to some extent. In the [video of the La Marzocco Swift Mini of Sprometheus](https://youtu.be/RqMFGq6T51A) you get a good view into the internals of such a grind distribute and tamp mechanism like it is present in the Oracle. There you can see the sheer amount in proximity to the impeller.  In the same video on the swift mini one drawback of the grinder is the inconsistency of consecutive shots of the same settings. There he shows how distribution issues and channeling are present in four of shots out of ten from a bottomless portalfilter. I frequently see similar indications of channeling in the puck that he showed too. I know it is a different grinder but it is more expensive and the second generation for La Marzocco who carry some weight in the world of espresso. So 2 isnt just necessarily a measure in hardness and dampness but a (hard to measure) cross section of the puck indicating the distribution of the grounds causing a possible channel. I also see the puck looking well tamped and saturated with liquid in most of my shots. But sadly that doesnt exclude channeling which could absolutely increase the total output of g of coffee in the same time like you described.  A scientific approach on this would be to re-distribute an already tamped puck from the Oracle with a WDT tool and tamp it manually. One could then measure the time until a certain weight of coffee is extracted and compare to the classical approach. It would have to be spaced in time to avoid overheating as discussed in 3.  Another issue could be if you use a different portalfilter basked which isnt rough on the surface. If the puck doesnt grip throughout the entire process the distribution could be inconsistent. Ive especially seen this issue with the single basket which I avoid entirely.,i3uz6le,/r/espresso/comments/ty81q0/calibration_problems_with_sagebreville_the_oracle/i40t88s/'

i3q8nu8,2022-04-06 22:39:57,Noobplzforgive,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,I have a df64.   I want to address the cons first. Ive had positive experience with espresso outlet so far. Theres a fifty dollar coupon you can use. Dm me and Ill dig through some emails to see if I can find it for you. The new df64 has updated declumper and fonts and stuff. Theres not much of a static issue when making espresso. More so for filter really. The mods will address mainly qol stuff. Like anti popcorn funnel cup tilter or 10 degrees tilt base.   Pros: I actually dont know if I would say its easy to come back to espresso and dial in just where you left off when coming from filter back to espresso grind settings. I feel like it does behave a bit hypersensitively when going towards the finer end. The dial ticks are kind of tiny to me lol. I mean its a wide range and they had to make it fit so I understand. but when it comes to fine tuning I do go like half step increments to the best of my abilities. The dial indicator does help with that. They include the dial indicator and the cup tilter as an upgrade option. Which is basically free if the coupon works for you.,-,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i3q8nu8/'

It‚Äôs between the DF64 Mignon Specialita or jumping on the Niche Zero bandwagon. I hold the same hesitation with the build quality from the DF64.

i3q8m98,2022-04-06 22:39:27,Worldly_Celebration3,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,I‚Äôve owned all three. I think your pros and cons are pretty accurate. The choice IMO depends what you value most in a grinder.  My experience and opinions based on my flavour preference:  DF64: best shots of the group many burr options built like a tank annoying stock pf/dosing cup fork messy horrible stock clump crusher kinda loud feels like a prototype  Silenzio: well built unbelievably quiet annoying stock hopper (gate)  ok shots  Vario (old model ceramic only pretty beat up): feels pretty flimsy pretty loud finicky adjustment mechanism ok shots  They‚Äôre all decent grinders but none are end game IMO. Switching between methods sucks on all 3. I vote you keep your encore for filter. They all single dose pretty well.   I was chasing a flavour profile with more clarity than the mignon or vario produced. I found what I wanted with the stock italmil burrs in the DF. I can‚Äôt say I love using it though.   TLDR:  I enjoyed the Silenzio user experience the most like Baratza as a company the best for customer service etc (I‚Äôve owned 3) enjoy the shots from the DF the best.  Good luck  Edit: If budget and single dosing are high on your list I would seriously consider the Sette 30 or a good hand grinder.

(Mostly because I have some friends who are keen to buy my specialita or I probably wouldn‚Äôt have thought about it too much) Happy to answer any specific questions!  For what it‚Äôs worth I plan on upgrading the burrs to red speed as I get it and I plan on buying it from a local company (alternative brewing in Australia) as they‚Äôll handle warranty through their distributor if necessary though it‚Äôs pretty simple tech and the new burrs probably void warranty anyway.  I‚Äôve been hopper dosing my specialita for about 3 years now and honestly it‚Äôs great.

i3q4fke,2022-04-06 21:53:38,gotshrimp59,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,Ive been wanting to try the df64 but Im afraid the declump chute will produce uneven fines.  I have a specialita and I single dose with it only. It has a hopper gate which I toss my beans into and then I start the grinder and just pull the hopper gate. It gets really consistent grinds and the flavors are quite good. I will say the filter brews with it are quite boring but I definitely enjoy it for espresso. Its also really well built,-,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i3q4fke/'
i3q9pp1,2022-04-06 22:52:08,rbpx,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,Mmm you say Baratza Vario but not Vario+ or Vario W+.  Im not keen on the Vario but it looks like Baratza has come out swinging with their + and W+. Yes this ups the price fer sure. But what remains interesting about this choice is the promise (hope?) that it can double duty espresso and drip coffee.  Im very happy with my Silenzio. I too wonder if the cost to move up to DF64 (plus mods) makes sense.  I think youll be fine with any one of these three (well... there are a few Varios and lots of Mignons). I added the [etsy SD kit](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1096746734/eureka-mignon-single-dose-hopper-with) which I feel is a terrific upgrade. I just cant sleep at night thinking that those expensive beans are sitting out getting oxidized in a hopper.  BTW re SD kit: you have to decide whether to also add the anti-popcorn weight. As I fought popcorning in the hopper I decided to splurge for this. Oddly at first I was getting wildly random retention! What was happening? I finally figured out that *sometimes* a bean or two could get pinned under the anti-popcorn weight. The fix was to leave the bellows off until the grind was mostly done. Then lift the weight to make sure theres no pinned beans then put the bellows on and give a good pump (almost all extra grinds come out with one pump). This complicates the workflow a bit but now I get great results and can heartily recommend the anti-popcorn weight. NB. I feel that popcorning is somewhat harmful and it disrupts the flow rate of beans through the burrs and (possibly) affects the grinds output profile. Many Single Dosing products dont provide any anti-popcorning feature (just a lid to keep the beans inside).   Im not sure if popcorning is an issue for the DF64 but it is for the Mignon and I suspect it is for the Vario.,-,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i3q9pp1/'
i3qc83a,2022-04-06 23:22:28,Acaconym,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,I have a modded vario. The steel burrs are very slow but I‚Äôm actually very happy with the coffee it makes with light roasts. The ceramic burrs were actually pretty good too not as much for filter but probably better than the encore. The metal grind chamber is helpful but not totally needed flipping the flapper on the outlet chute makes retention pretty minimal really. Definitely not zero but minimal. Going back and forth between filter and espresso works well for me.   Biggest beef I have with it is that the touch point kinda wanders around so for espresso I generally have to start the motor and find the touch point set the grind size relative to that then dump the beans into the hopper. It works but it feels a little goofy. Then once the batch is done I drop the macro down to 10 and that knocks almost all the retained grounds out. So not smooth workflow but it‚Äôs also not messy. Less messy than the encore was.   All in all I am not looking for an upgrade the steel burrs are awesome and the rest is either good or tolerable. Maybe the df would be better but it looks like it has its own problems too it‚Äôs just a matter of what you‚Äôre willing to put up with. They‚Äôre probably both pretty good choices.

If your only doing espresso they are practically the same.  I don‚Äôt have any mods except a pointer on the DF64.  I don‚Äôt have static issues and I don‚Äôt RDT.  The Eureka I have a single dose hopper and bellows.  I find the DF64 to have a better PF holder and thus I use it 99% of the time.  I just slide my PF in the forks and grind into it.

Has always wanted to find out.   I really don‚Äôt care how much faster it grinds. Niche zero is also a simple China grinder with an Italian burr the fact that it‚Äôs designed in UK means very little to me. So I don‚Äôt think DF64 build quality is questionable and at least so far it seem like DF64 owners rarely if ever complain anything regarding the build quality. But ultimately  I just want to know if I will taste a better cup or not DF64 vs Eureka 50mm.,-,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i3q5bhb/'

I have it and even unmodded it blows the Specialita I have out of the water for grind quality with you considering the lower tier mignons and already wanting the single doser then its an easy call.  I dont have any experience with the vario but if you like single dosing I dont think I would go with something else for the money. Only possible consideration would be to see what the new DF64P has to offer when it comes out in a few weeks.,-,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i3sc85f/'

Ive been considering this decision for a while and finally decided on a Eureka Mignon Specialita from ECS. Total OTD was $407 which is a bleeding steal for this lol.

i3t37df,2022-04-07 13:17:17,Iggy95,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,The + and W+ are tempting but definitely stretching my budget since they start at $530 and $600. Im generally trying to keep things at roughly $400 or under (EDIT: and yes Im aware the DF64 runs around $425-450 depending where you buy it but thats kinda my stretch limit). I would rather put that savings into a better machine down the line as Im still on an Delonghi ECP 3630.    Those single-dosing mods look tempting! Ive seen a few videos of them in action and they seem to work quite well for reducing retention.   Ive heard that popcorning is somewhat an issue on DF64s although no more than any other grinder that doesnt have a specific anti-popcorn feature (e.g. Niche).,i3q9pp1,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i3t37df/'

i3sdlun,2022-04-07 10:35:45,filthysven,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,Thats an interesting question. The DF64 undeniably produces better grinds. Theyre fluffier and clump free while my Specialita produces a mess of clumps even after burr break in. That said can you taste the difference? A little I think but not too much. Theyre both high quality grinders and it takes a pretty sensitive palate and a very good dial in to be able to reliably tell whats the grinder and whats the million other variables. I think the DF64 stock burrs are little cleaner the mignon burrs are a little more bodies on average. I think DF64 produces slightly better espresso for my tastes but I dont think that would be the case for everyone or all that noticeable if you werent looking for it. But with the extra control better grind bed and easier tuning I look the DF64 at this point when I do straight espressos or more interesting pulls like allonges and the specialita for a fast pull that will wind up in milk or an Americano. One day Ill sell one but not sure which. I think the 64 is better but the specialita is more convenient without the single dosing.,i3q5bhb,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i3sdlun/'
i4069va,2022-04-08 23:28:36,rbpx,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,Congrats. Where did you get that price? Up here its $800 CAD (ON SALE!).  I found with my Silenzio that it worked well even before it was broken in. Eventually I had to align the burrs though. Be careful when you take off the upper burr plate for cleaning. Its attached with three screws (NB. NEVER over-tighten these screws). When you open it up the FIRST TIME take a sharpee permanent pen and mark the upper burr plate and the surrounding metal chamber so that you know the orientation to return it to when you screw it back together.   I found it a bit tricky to dial in at first but Im very pleased that the dial is precise enough that I can get my 18g in 36g out in \~30s easily (not that I use those numbers exactly).  With the hopper the chute gets plugged up pretty fast. Each new grind can push thru that but every time you open it up to clean (at first I cleaned each week now more like every 2 weeks) the chute needs  a thin screwdriver stuck down into the chute to clear out the plugged grinds if you want to do that. So dont concern yourself when you see that when cleaning. Its the way it is. However the chute does not get plugged up with the SD kit replacing the hopper as the pump of the bellows blows that out each time.   Youre gonna love this grinder.,i3zpi4h,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i4069va/'
i3t73a2,2022-04-07 13:42:35,rbpx,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,>The + and W+ are tempting but definitely stretching my budget  Well that rules out the DF64 as well no? That would still be my flavour pick. Second to that the Mignon Cronos+burrs should be the quality choice (both in flavour and reliability). Mind you Ive got a Silenzio so I may be biased. Its well made quiet and dependable (although I did have to align it which wasnt fun).  I like the Baratza company they always get lauded for their Customer Support a rare commodity these days. Ive read some complaints about trying to get the right grind with a Vario which makes me hesitate - but I dont own one so I dont really know how it fairs (only that the + seems to get a big thumbs up in the reviews). Its got something to do with whether the burr chamber is made of plastic or metal.   Hopefully some of the chatter here can give you some feedback to work off of.

That sharpee trick sounds like a savior its surprising that it doesnt come with some marking out of the box lol. I think even the encore had a red tab to align the upper burr properly.

My answer is still no - because I cant and the benefit vs cost difference (selling the Silenzio privately) isnt good enough (I think). Instead its fun to think about jumping up to the P64.  Back when I bought my grinder I didnt know enough about the DF64 to take a chance on it (and it was high Covid season and nothing was available anyway). I still think the DF64 is one of those sweet spots out there. Love all the mods for it.  Anyway Ill have to wait for the lotto winnings...,i4053nc,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i406w4o/'
i41h8g3,2022-04-09 07:54:29,Worldly_Celebration3,ty51my,Analysis Paralysis: Vario vs DF64 vs Eureka Mignon,Happy to help!  I think your logic regarding upgrades is bang on. If youre happy with your current setup making a small upgrade probably isnt worth it. Waiting to make a bigger jump is probably a good plan.  The DF may produce a slightly better shot (for me) and have more burr options but I think the mignon is a nicer user experience personally. I cant say one is BETTER than the other.  I do currently have SSP MP burrs installed in my DF. I bought them for my Ode but figured Id give them a try for espresso. They produce some really interesting shots if youre into lighter coffees and longer ratios. I think I generally prefer the more traditional profile from the italmil burrs overall. I will likely keep the MP burrs in the Ode maybe do the stepless mod and pull the occasional shot with it.,i406w4o,/r/espresso/comments/ty51my/analysis_paralysis_vario_vs_df64_vs_eureka_mignon/i41h8g3/'

In the US stefanos [espressocare.com](https://espressocare.com) has lots of parts and in the EU [coffee-sensor.com](https://coffee-sensor.com) does as well.   A good hand grinder like the 1zpresso JX-pro or one of the similar units can grind finely enough. Or you can look at the Baratza grinders or the DF64.

i3rahxj,2022-04-07 06:03:37,SirWaddlesworth,ty389f,My first coffee setup. I got matching accessories.,Im just going off of what Ive read in reviews and such but my understanding is that so long as you give it adequate warm up time (30 minutes or so) then you do not need to do a cooling flush.

i3rp83w,2022-04-07 07:51:52,Dura_Max,ty389f,My first coffee setup. I got matching accessories.,You will need to do a cooling flush if the machine is fully heated and left on without use for 20 minutes or longer. The cooling flush purges the over heated water from the exchange coil inside the steam boiler. This is and will always be a part of the HX design regardless of PID or not. The PID replaces the old presurestat design. It allows you to control of steam temp and inversely the brew temp but it cannot control over heating the brew water left in the coil.,i3r0vl0,/r/espresso/comments/ty389f/my_first_coffee_setup_i_got_matching_accessories/i3rp83w/'

Even the tiniest mark on the steel shows up very clearly. I tried to clean some areas a few times over and even then there are still some pretty visible marks.  Its kind of interesting I set up a softbox to the left but the entrance to my bedroom is behind the kitchen in my apartment so I set up a high powered strobe to bounce around and try and use the whole doorway as a light source as well.

If you are going with simonelli is it the Appia life model? If so then just another reason. The appia life is an updated version of thier longstanding appia.

You cant change out the basket? Uh? So if you ever change your dose you just cant use this $400 Portafilter? It stays cleaner longer? Who is getting grinds between the basket and their pf? I guess Ive only had my machine for three months but my pf looks the same it did on day one.  The only angle a $400 pf has is one of pure quality like a high quality wood handle or some form of tech integration. This is quite literally a $400 pf for zero subjective or objective value.

i3qdlfb,2022-04-06 23:39:48,thrBeachBoy,ty0p53,Communitys Thoughts on This???,Everyone argues about acid bath and price. But lets see the other arguments. As one poster noted maybe one Hoffman YouTube video away from becoming a must have  It has a much larger area with the holes than standard pf It is made to use with paper filters and their new screen.  The two info above might be the variables that actually change something in extraction with the same diameter at top and bottom of puck etc. Forget the cleaning bs  The price stays outrageous ($395 for the wood handle) but it might actually be something providing some improvements.  Text from their release:  Used in conjunction with Weber‚Äôs EPFs (Espresso Paper Filter) releasing the same day as the Unifilter and the included mesh flow disruptor a barista can unlock more from your espresso shot than has ever been possible. Improved extraction means less wasted shots and that in turn means less wasted coffee.

They know the espresso community has money to burn. I mean another company gets away with selling an extremely small piece of Chinese made aluminum for $80.

If they sold that for the artful aesthetic design at maybe half that price theyd probably would sell way more than twice as many and wouldnt have alienated so many people. Same goes for the customer service- they need to shut the eff up and just do good business.

The cleanup however is a different story.  If the coffee puck is too far down then water will usually collect on top of it after the shot is stopped so when you try to clean it used coffee water gets everywhere especially when you try to invert the portafilter to knock into a knockbox.  If the puck is too high then the puck will occasionally stick to the screen after the shot is stopped and if you dont realize it has immediately after you take off the now empty portafilter then the puck will fall onto the drip tray.  It is *not* fun to pick up a 200 degree mass of loose wet coffee and then wipe off the remains and scrub the screen.,i3rznqc,/r/espresso/comments/ty0p53/communitys_thoughts_on_this/i3so1i6/'

i3pt0bn,2022-04-06 20:06:54,caprimulgusAU,txz091,feel wasteful buying a 2nd WDT tool because I liked the weight of my friends one,From all my research into needle size I dont think there is really a consensus...some people have a preference from 0.2/0.22/0.25mm some people have a preference for 0.35mm or 0.4mm. As an example some people suggest 0.2mm for deep WDT followed by 0.4mm for shallow WDT/raking (on the basis that the thinner needles will be gentler and cause smaller holes / pockets throughout the bed) while some people suggest the exact opposite: 0.4mm for deep WDT followed by 0.2mm for shallow WDT/raking (on the basis that the thicker needles will b more effective in WDTing deeper in the bed)!  0.35mm is a pretty  popular choice and recommended by jkim himself from his testing (I believe he personally preferred 0.3mm but recommended 0.35mm as a more sturdy alternative - something like that).  I reckon 0.3 or 0.35 is a pretty safe option especially if you are sticking with 1 WDT only (which is sensible!). :)  FWIW Ill probably print 2 and try 0.2mm & 0.35mm and see what I prefer. I may use two different sizes for deep/shallow or may just end up sticking with 1 tool for everything with whichever size I prefer.,i3ps2y5,/r/espresso/comments/txz091/feel_wasteful_buying_a_2nd_wdt_tool_because_i/i3pt0bn/'

The Vario grinder I had pretty well dialed-in for my needs but I only ever made small changes to the Gaggia (only upgraded the gasket shower screen) so going from basically a slightly-educated crap shoot every shot to such consistency has been a huge shift. The All-purpose is a perfectly fine grinder and I honestly could‚Äôve easily gotten away with not replacing so soon.

Once youre dialled in to 1:2 25-30 seconds  start try longer or shorter shots  eg : 1:1 or 1:3 shots and decide for yourself how the taste changes.  I personally when drinking straight shots find that longer shots (1:3 or 4 ) really opens up the gamut of flavors .

i3qer0c,2022-04-06 23:54:43,rbpx,txxhxs,sub 2k PID machine suggestions? (no DIY),Your list confuses me. No doubt its price focused because youve got single boiler small dual boiler and HX machines on there. Also you dont specify your usage - Im going to assume you drink espressos Americanos and lattes.  My Oracle was packed up and driven across town for repairs 4x before I had had enough. Its a wonderful idea on paper but the grinder let it down and it had terrible reliability and the milk frother was crap.  I next went for the Profitec HX offering and I am quite impressed with the quality of materials. Im less enthusiastic about the P300 because unless you stick with medium-dark to dark roasts you may have need of preinfusion which isnt offered (quite odd).  ECM? Forget about a Single Boiler if you (or your wife) ***ever*** want to do milk drinks.  Appartamento? Theres no reason to buy a machine without a PID in 2022. Skip this.  Lelit Elizabeth is a strong performer but locally this is getting priced out of sight. YMMV.  The Unica doesnt show a water tap. What?  Dunno much about the (new) Silvia Pro X but it sure looks good in youtube reviews.  Id also look at the [Bellezza Bellona](https://idrinkcoffee.com/products/bellezza-bellona?variant=40290519482402&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6Ke_y9_19gIViq_ICh2T8A90EAQYASABEgIo5PD_BwE) which although brand new (so Caveat Emptor) comes from a good company. Its intro price has a spectacular discount. It also has all the features plus some intriguing innovations (eg. the manometer/pressure-gauge reports the brewhead pressure - not the boiler pressure).,-,/r/espresso/comments/txxhxs/sub_2k_pid_machine_suggestions_no_diy/i3qer0c/'

The main drawback is the slightly smaller non standard portafilter size but at least you can get IMS baskets so it‚Äôs not terrible. Will have less options for tampers and other accessories tho.  Small dual boiler with a decent temp control is better than single boiler Hx imo and possibly more practical if not as cool as a large db e61.

My wife can make coffee at 4am without too much fiddling. Front load water: check. Stability: check. Where is falls short is repeatability shot to shot but shots are great anyway so Ill forgive.  The worst part is reliability machine had two years warranty and Breville exchanged the machine twice. Now its broken again. I still have a store extended warranty but its just a matter of time before it becomes past tense.  Second worst is parts. I need a tiny $.25 gasket have to wait three months to ship it (the original one) from Australia (so long because lockdown).

My streams takes about 8-10secs to become a single stream,You have a long way to go but have made a good start.   I would suggest you upgrade your grinder you always need a better grinder. Looks like that one isnt grinding fine enough have you shimmed it?  Your espresso machine is at the bottom end for good espresso. You might get better results with temp surfing and until you get a better grinder you might consider a pressurised basket.  Your milk jug. Thats a disaster the milk was coming out clumpy and floating on top of the espresso. Watch the nespresso ads for how milk should look.

i3obmkq,2022-04-06 13:38:01,elegoomba,txvc95,Help choosing a machine (slightly ignorant coffee fan)!,Gonna be honest I don‚Äôt think espresso is right for you at this time! I would watch some James Hoffman and consider something like a a V60/pour over or French press either paired with a burr grinder. Very very low investment that gets to a whole world of good coffee.   If you really want to try espresso then there‚Äôs probably no entry point below $500 total for your grinder + machine that‚Äôs really worth exploring for you since not wanting a hobby would rule out more involved manual machines. My suggestion there would be a Breville Bambino and a Eureka Mignon Crono or a Hand Grinder like a JXpresso Pro.,-,/r/espresso/comments/txvc95/help_choosing_a_machine_slightly_ignorant_coffee/i3obmkq/'

We already settled on a french press but I forgot to purchase and now a machine is on the table (she really wants one). I really dont like the taste of filter coffee and my gf says it tastes like filter so im not too sure....  She currently does pouring. Seems like something that is nice to have at home anyways. I think i buy something better than the random plastic funnel she uses right now for that...  Interesting you recommend the Bambino. I see this recommended in a similiar thread here.  I am a bit confused. I can not finde the breville bambino in the shop i want to buy. But instead I find a totally same looking - and named - machine from the company SAGE. And the weird thing is it is the totally same machine except for the engraving - atleast form the picture. Is that just the european market name or something?

In summer I also make nice drinks with the shaker too. :D  For your last question - Im not really sure. I just look how cafes in italy and nice cafes make coffee and they always have these portafilter things. So this got me curious. With my bialetti I just filled the coffee holder thing up maybe half way poured a decent shot milk into it and sipped my 6 cup - cup that is about as strong as 2 cup espresso... :)  I really dont like the idea of using single use filters (I even have a water-HEPA based vacuum),i3oeayb,/r/espresso/comments/txvc95/help_choosing_a_machine_slightly_ignorant_coffee/i3ogk1w/'

Another option with filter is getting a metal/reusable filter which can take away the filter taste and let the yummy oils through.  Sage and Breville are the same just different markets!   Everyone in this sub will probably tell you to spend more on your grinder than your machine and that‚Äôs pretty good advice when starting out.

Its still working great and it has a nob to control the pressure. It honestly made a decent espresso for pressurized and its manual pour meaning if you dont stop it it keeps going which is great for a full cup if you take out the drip tray a normal cup should fit under there.

Or any end-game grinder for that matter?,Your analogy with the margaritas is interesting but maybe not in a way that you expect. Most margaritas have way more not-tequila ingredients than tequila so youre mostly tasting fruit juice and it doesnt really matter how good the tequila is. The same is true of milk drinks. You dont need a really fantastic grinder to make a latte. If thats all you want to drink then theres really no point in getting anything fancier than a specialita/niche because few people will even taste the difference and fewer people will care. But if youre drinking just espresso you can tell the difference - taste texture mouth feel all of that can be affected by the grinder. I bet you and your friends could tell the difference between a shot of good tequila and bad tequila and you could also probably taste the difference between a $700 grinder and a $1700 grinder.,-,/r/espresso/comments/txu70e/is_there_any_substancial_difference_between_1000/i3p2utb/'

I use only a tamper or sometimes distribution tool+tamper. The WDT tool makes no difference for this grinder so I assume it makes no clumps.      What I would like for my endgame upgrade?  1. Dosing by grams not by seconds. 2. Consistency in grind settings. I guess this is the price you pay for the stepless grinder: the number on the dial ring means nothing.

Many people just don‚Äôt care about this though.   If you like milk drinks and or sugar it‚Äôs not worth it no.  If you are as nerdy about espresso as most of us are then yes it‚Äôs worth every penny.  Endgame in home espresso are like 83 & 93mm burr grinders.   What I think is silly is all the people with $5k machines and a niche zero‚Ä¶   The $2500 grinder with high end burrs + the $500 Gaggia will allow you to pull tastier shots than you ever thought possible. It probably will change the kind of coffee you like entirely. (It did for me)  Machines are for the gram the grinders put in the work and stack up the gains.,i3op4ac,/r/espresso/comments/txu70e/is_there_any_substancial_difference_between_1000/i3otxht/'

They don‚Äôt really make sense on a heat exchanger machine IMO where the brew water goes through a heat exchanger in the steam boiler. You just aren‚Äôt going to get really precise brew temp control in that kind of system. Starting temp on the thermometer was a good gauge of the brew temp adding a cooling flush if it‚Äôs too high. If I wanted a 202F shot I could usually hit it within +/- 1 degree.

Dosing 17g in an 18g basket I get 34g in 34s from 15F on my Sette 270 and 43g in 22 sec from 15H on my current beans. Thats the biggest gap Ive seen only two stops apart. Like /u/ayyysalute mentioned at that point its best to play with dosing so Im doing 17.5g in now at 15H and that yields 43g out in 25s which is \*about\* right for this roast.

i3o9eiy,2022-04-06 13:24:23,xjtian,txt22e,Four months in I can‚Äôt make a good espresso,It‚Äôs a fools errand to try and extract light roasts with a standard flat 9 bar profile. I‚Äôd even go so far as to say that it‚Äôs just impossible to pull an evenly extracted light roast shot with any traditional pressure profile.  Light roasts are far less soluble than traditional espresso roasts and as a result have much lower puck integrity. With a traditional 9 bar profile meant for traditional espresso roasts you‚Äôre slamming a low-integrity puck with water and channelling all over the place. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre pulling shots that are sour and bitter at the same time.  You have 2 options:  1.	Buy darker beans 2.	Use a profile that‚Äôs more appropriate for your roast level. The Hendon ‚Äúturbo shot‚Äù is particularly well-suited for light roasts: 6bar 3:1 shots that pull in 15-20 seconds. Results are improved if you can make your machine do a dynamic bloom (Google ‚Äúturbo bloom‚Äù for details).  Gear-wise look into bottom paper filters. They‚Äôre pretty important for light roast shots because it‚Äôs so much more difficult to achieve an even flow of water through the puck. A puck screen on top will also improve flow evenness.  If you want to keep pulling light roasts you‚Äôll have to make some significant adjustments to your process. https://youtu.be/YPEE9Lsb1oE is a great video to take some inspiration from here.,-,/r/espresso/comments/txt22e/four_months_in_i_cant_make_a_good_espresso/i3o9eiy/'

i3oeiud,2022-04-06 13:55:58,simon-brown,txt22e,Four months in I can‚Äôt make a good espresso,Ive had my MaraX for a couple of months (no OPV adjustment it hits just over 10 bars on the gauge when brewing) and struggled a little initially. Part of this was down to a new grinder but some things that helped include:  - Dose: I use the 14-18g basket and 17.5-18.5g has worked well for most beans so far. When tamped the top of the included tamper tends to sit almost flush with the top of the basket which seems to be a nice spot for dry pucks after brewing. - Grinding: If you have a dosing cup try grinding into that rather than directly into the portafilter. This will allow you to shake the cup to break up any clumps (likely not an issue with a Specialita?) and even out any grind size irregularities. - WDT: My focus for WDT is about distributing the coffee in the basket rather than breaking up clumps. Ill WDT for a few seconds and give the portafilter a gentle vertical tap to settle the coffee. If the coffee is uneven (sloped) in the basket Ill repeat the process to move the coffee to the lower side followed by another gentle vertical tap. And repeat until the coffee is flat and even after a vertical tap. - Tamping: The included tamper is lovely but Im not particularly good at tamping level. üòÇ Ill get downvoted for this but if your leveller is adjustable try setting the depth of the leveller to the depth of the tamper and using it instead of the tamper. You might be pleasantly surprised at the consistency you can achieve by doing this. I have a Normcore V4 on order because I want to take tamping out of the equation.  Ive mostly used light-medium coffee on my MaraX and temperature settings 0 and 1 have been fine so far. If youre using a really light roast you might want to try setting 2. Shot times for me are anywhere between 30-40s from pulling the lever up. As others have said definitely try shorter (e.g. 18g in 30g out) and longer (e.g. 18g in 40+g out) ratios.,-,/r/espresso/comments/txt22e/four_months_in_i_cant_make_a_good_espresso/i3oeiud/'

That shot time/ratio is just a *first timer guideline* not some holy grail target that guarantees a good shot.  Those guidelines are targeted toward medium/medium-dark roasts anyway. You need to break those rules when you go lighter.  You need to extract more and more evenly for light roasts. The most popular way to do this is to coarsen up the grind to decrease the chance of channelling and pull a longer ratio to compensate for extraction. Try adjusting your grind so you get something like 1:3 in 20 seconds. See how that goes and then adjust the rest by taste.  Note that by increasing the flow rate your bottomless portafilter shots are going to look funnier. Theyre not going to look like gooey Instagram porn shots but who cares thats the way it goes when youre dialing in light roasts by taste.,-,/r/espresso/comments/txt22e/four_months_in_i_cant_make_a_good_espresso/i3ohq25/'

Where are you getting your beans and how fresh are they? What temperature is your machine set at? Beans are super important I actually recommend buying from a local roaster/cafe so you can taste how they pull their shots and try to mimic it.   The rest of what you are doing sounds correct though. You may need to adjust your recipe and if your beans are fresh I would even try contacting the roaster to see what ratio and temperature they recommend.   I understand the frustration it‚Äôs real. I spent a long time dialing in a certain bean until I asked the roaster. They recommended a 1:1 ratio and a very specific temperature and pull time.

In any case I like light roasts and that‚Äôs why I would like to be able to brew those at home.,i3nuhyw,/r/espresso/comments/txt22e/four_months_in_i_cant_make_a_good_espresso/i3nvtyw/'

Paper disk aside my workflow is awfully similar to James‚Äôs. Also I don‚Äôt want to buy anything else in case it turns out I‚Äôm shit at this hobby.

i3nx8qe,2022-04-06 12:10:11,MyCatsNameIsBernie,txt22e,Four months in I can‚Äôt make a good espresso,>	Yes I meant 1:2 and I never tried longer ratios.  This might be your biggest issue. Light roasts usually require a longer ratio. Try 1:2.5 or 1:3. Also set your brew priority temp to the 3rd (max) level.  There is nothing magic about 1:2. Its a good starting point for medium roasts but it should never be treated as the end goal.   When dialing in you should always experiment with different ratios and find what tastes best.,i3nvtyw,/r/espresso/comments/txt22e/four_months_in_i_cant_make_a_good_espresso/i3nx8qe/'
i3ny349,2022-04-06 12:15:19,ayyysalute,txt22e,Four months in I can‚Äôt make a good espresso,Sour and bitter does indicate channeling and uneven extraction so make sure your puck prep is on point.  For a light roast try a 1:2.5 ratio or 1:3. Lower your dose too maybe. One of James Hoffmann‚Äôs dialing in tutorials is done with a lighter roast ended up going for like 17g in 40g out and I found it very helpful.  Don‚Äôt be discouraged dialing in with a light roast is basically espresso on hard mode. Some mediums can be very juicy and acidic if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after while being much easier to dial in.,i3nvtyw,/r/espresso/comments/txt22e/four_months_in_i_cant_make_a_good_espresso/i3ny349/'

i3q5hkk,2022-04-06 22:04:54,Kooseh,txt22e,Four months in I can‚Äôt make a good espresso,Id say rather volume than ratio. Because if its too sour you want to achieve more extraction. To increase extraction you can do these things:     * Increase temperature    * Increase yield    * Grind finer  But Im just regurgitating things Ive read here. Struggling myself.

i3o2800,2022-04-06 12:40:42,MaddabbaM,txt22e,Four months in I can‚Äôt make a good espresso,Yes dont get hung up on 1:2.  I brew 1:2.5(ish) because I enjoy the taste.  The thing to strive for is making an espresso you enjoy regardless of all other factors.  Temp ratio time etc are only measurements to help you replicate your shot consistently.  They arent rules you need to live by.    Unfortunately Espresso can be fickle and it is part of the fun (hopefully).  Ive gone through whole bags that I couldnt dial in very well.  Sure it sucked but the next bag was all the sweeter when I did dial it in.

i3on290,2022-04-06 14:51:19,Yakarue,txryvx,grind finer?,Im not a professional but my gross amount of hours researching latte art has made a very adamant case for never steaming your milk first. Your milk sitting post-steam while you pull your shot will have a far more negative impact than your espresso shot sitting for 30 seconds. Ideally you get them timed as close together as possible but always pull your shot first. Even a few moments hesitation post polishing swirl can result in a noticeable separation of foam and milk impacting your pour.,i3o9vmz,/r/espresso/comments/txryvx/grind_finer/i3on290/'

And the machine and cup rinser are countersunk and fed via different reservoirs underneath there as well. The knock box is also countersunk. The cart is on wheels and I have this vision of taking it to a farmers market or friends wedding or something and then serving espresso drinks. I also have a half-sized fridge next to it.

i3p1t82,2022-04-06 16:38:04,gotshrimp59,txribe,Breville Barista Express or Breville Dual Boiler,If youre looking to steam milk or mainly at milk beverages I would definitely not get the barista express.

Its a great grinder for workflow and an amazing daily driver for good price. Theyre quite common for people getting into espresso so youll likely find one on FB marketplace too. If you dont mind handgriding for espresso the 1zPresso grinders are pretty good but you might hate yourself having to hand grind shots all the time.

i3nl4ct,2022-04-06 10:55:05,gotshrimp59,txribe,Breville Barista Express or Breville Dual Boiler,Agree with LeiLei on this. It also comes with the risk that heat exchange machines sometimes get thermosyphon stall which is when the heat exchanger literally stalls and you have to flush the grouphead before it starts up again.  I also think having the separate grinder is much nicer and you can always keep the dual boiler as a constant and upgrade grinder if you ever need to upgrade your setup. The dual boiler is well liked and plenty explored with some cool mods you can do on it too. Lance Hedrick does lots of his videos on the breville dual boiler and the amount of features theyve packed into it for that price point are second to none,i3njtyh,/r/espresso/comments/txribe/breville_barista_express_or_breville_dual_boiler/i3nl4ct/'

Theres a super famous third wave roaster where I live in upstate NY. When I got into the home espresso game and was having trouble dialing in their signature espresso blend I called them ahead of time to check if I could come in to taste a well-extracted shot (it was not exactly early morning and Id read that well dialed-in settings tend to drift away over the course of the day so I just wanted to be absolutely sure). They were very cordial and excited and asked me to visit ASAP and so I went. What they served me after all that interaction tasted like someone took vinegar and squeezed a lemon into it lmao. It was sour AF but the under-extraction was only balanced by their over-excitement which made me too afraid to tell them the truth.

I used to start work stupid early in the morning so Id grab a flat white and some kind of baked good from McDonalds but theyve withdrawn almost all of the McCaf√© menu in the UK so I started going to Starbucks instead.  Great cinnamon swirls but the coffee... Never tasted of coffee. It was always gallons of hot sweet milk even in a flat white. So one day (incidentally the day I had to wear a suit and was thus in a white shirt) I ordered an espresso from Starbucks and nearly gagged so hard I almost spilled it all over myself. It was like battery acid. Absolutely putrid.

The interior was well laid out and the equipment behind the bar was phenomenal. The sort of setup Id kill to play with. I was with a work buddy that had never had an espresso drink before. I asked him if he wanted something a little mellower or if he just wanted to dive into something strong. He wanted to go for it so I ordered us up a couple Macchiattos (After verifying that they made traditional volume Macchiatos rather than a modern 16oz caramel abomination).    I told my coworker that it seemed like they had their shit together. Everything seemed to be going great until I heard the barista talking to her coworker about how she was experimenting and found the perfect shot. Her secret was to grind it much coarser than normal tamp it light and run the shot a lot quicker to get the same shot weight. Her goal was a 15 second pull. My heart sank. I knew exactly what I would be getting. I warned my coworker before the drinks came out that it was going to be sour as shit. And I was right. The most sour unappealing channeled underextracted mess of a drink Ive had in my life. Even the dash of steamed milk didnt help at all.    And honestly its a shame. Their beans are really good.

i3npzy4,2022-04-06 11:25:25,rbpx,txnwd9,Discussion: Did you like the way espresso tasted immediately?,I think the excessively sugarized diet were all eating now colours this issue. Espresso is naturally bitter an while theres nothing bad about that our taste expectations dont have a lot of room for it. In the early years I found that if Id suck in a lot of air with the first taste to normalize myself to the bitter that everything was fine after that.  However less than quality espressos can also be sour (aka nasty) and Ive never gotten used to that.   Most non-espresso people dont know that underneath that barrier-to-entry bitterness lies a remarkable taste palate of flavours. The one that surprised me the most was not all the fruity flavours but just its basic sweetness. How is this possible in a bitter drink? Dont sweet and bitter cancel one another out?  I drink a cappuccino for the *texture* not the taste. Milk muffles a lot of the nuance of the taste of an espresso while tempering the bitter. The only issue I have with an espresso is the lack of volume. Man thats very awesome drink but its over quick!,-,/r/espresso/comments/txnwd9/discussion_did_you_like_the_way_espresso_tasted/i3npzy4/'

I did notice across the board from wine whisky and coffee that good quality was imperative for me liking the taste.

The two main things you‚Äôre going to want to look at when comparing microfiber towels are:  1) GSM (grams per square meter) 2) Pile type (high medium or low)  In the specific use of the towels for espresso machine cleaning I would recommend a medium pile with a GSM of 400-550.  And as for waffle weave vs regular the waffle would have a slight edge on capturing fine particulate debris like coffee grounds except for if it was low pile.

I see a lot of both so what are the advantages or disadvantages on both of them?,Bath towels. Go big or go home baby  If you want a serious answer Im not into microfiber for concerns of shedding over time. Waffle weave looks nice but keep in mind itll be washed a lot and always have some coffee stains on it so it wont look fabulous 99% of the time.  I opted for basic cotton hand towel/rags. Big pack of them at Costco for like 20 bucks. They absorb great I can change them out as often as I want and never worry about them wearing out since theyre just 100% cotton rags.,-,/r/espresso/comments/txns9q/looking_to_buy_some_barista_towels_but_i_cant/i3nev1c/'

I see a lot of both so what are the advantages or disadvantages on both of them?,If youre looking at two towels of the same quality a waffle weave will absorb more water. But for the purpose of making espresso you arent really in need of excess water absorption capabilities. Unless youre a serial spiller.   But this is why some of the nicer body towels are often waffle weave. Either way just make sure youre getting microfiber. The biggest difference youll notice in towel quality will be whether its microfiber or not.  The tldr is: if you like the way the waffle weave looks you should get them but they wont make a difference in your workflow over other microfiber options.,-,/r/espresso/comments/txns9q/looking_to_buy_some_barista_towels_but_i_cant/i3nix2a/'

The waffle are my least favourite of all towles though they do look great when clean.  They drop grinds that get into the waffle pits and they dont pick up small crumbs or grinds well.  Cheap cotton white terry cloth dish towels do the best job for me.  You can oxy clean or bleach them back to white easily.  They also protect your hands the best while cleaning the steam wand.

They get the job done with a huge astrix. You cannot wash microfiber with regular detergent. The fabric softeners and other chemicals in regular detergent coat the microfibers and prevent the towel from being absorbent. I washed them with regular detergent for maybe 4 washes and they were completely useless. I have a special microfiber detergent that I use for my auto detailing microfibers bit it pretty expensive. Alternatively you can use fragrance and softener free detergents like Tide Free and Gentle or All Free and Clear. Another draw back about microfiber is that most of them have a pretty low melting point around 140f 60c. There is a possibility of them melting on a steam wand or cleaning up hot water. In this use case regular vs waffle is mostly aesthetic. The absorbabcey difference between the two in a coffee environment will be pretty minimal. Honestly if I were buying rags again for my set up I would just get a bunch of commercial cotton terry towels.,-,/r/espresso/comments/txns9q/looking_to_buy_some_barista_towels_but_i_cant/i3p2wns/'

I see a lot of both so what are the advantages or disadvantages on both of them?,Turkish towels are thin pure cotton woven cloth- because they are usually loomed they have a knotted fringe at the bottom. They are used in Turkish saunas. I suggest them because they have a bit of class and practicality.   I used to be a barista. I found thin terry rags worked best but they always got trashed and if you were short of towels they couldn‚Äôt be rinsed completely free of grounds and you‚Äôd be moving them around as much as removing them.   At home I use linen to dry in the kitchen but not on my coffee gear. Thin cotton towels work best. I searched high and low to get black. I despise using bleach.,i3nujsd,/r/espresso/comments/txns9q/looking_to_buy_some_barista_towels_but_i_cant/i3nzas5/'

But in my house I honestly sometimes forget to change the towels too long cause its so dry they always feel crisp. Even if theyre actually not clean.

i3mrndx,2022-04-06 07:48:39,lemonader19,txnr3v,My shots are bitter at the top and sweet at bottom?,Thats pretty standard if youre not stirring your shots. The stuff extracted first is salts/sugars then the bitter plant fibers at the end. When you stir it should give you a balanced shot.

i3nwnd4,2022-04-06 12:06:27,Eigenspace,txnr3v,My shots are bitter at the top and sweet at bottom?,I mean if you‚Äôre getting a different flavour on the top versus the bottom then **clearly** the drink isn‚Äôt mixed evenly so you should try another method.   A spoon is certainly more effective at mixing layers than a swirl would be.,i3mtjyd,/r/espresso/comments/txnr3v/my_shots_are_bitter_at_the_top_and_sweet_at_bottom/i3nwnd4/'
i3ni9sy,2022-04-06 10:37:33,nameisjoey,txnr3v,My shots are bitter at the top and sweet at bottom?,Yes in my experience. I always stir vigorously. You are obviously experiencing separation your shot should be uniform in flavor from start to finish.   The only other possibility is your shot is really hot and as it cools you are tasting the sweetness which is also normal.   Try stirring and let us know!,i3mtjyd,/r/espresso/comments/txnr3v/my_shots_are_bitter_at_the_top_and_sweet_at_bottom/i3ni9sy/'
